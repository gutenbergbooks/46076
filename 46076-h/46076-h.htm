<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>No one will expect a life of Bach to be amusing, but
it will be my own fault if the present Essay does not
offer an interest of a high and varied character. If
it labours under a disadvantage, as the first biography
of the master written in this country, on the other
hand it is only now that, thanks to the devotion
of Professor Spitta, we can congratulate ourselves
on the possession of absolutely all the attainable
facts. Hitherto, three translations or abridgements
of German works have appeared in England; and
the first is one of those books which, however incomplete,
can never really be superseded. It is a
translation of the “Life” of J. N. Forkel, published
at Leipzig in 1802, and in London in 1820. Forkel
was not only pre-eminent among the learned musicians
of the end of the last century, but also the friend and
scholar of Bach’s sons Friedemann and Emanuel. He
presents us, therefore, with more than a masterly
criticism of Bach’s science, knowing, it should seem,
little beyond the organ and clavichord works: he is
full of anecdotes and reminiscences of the master, all
the more valuable, because told with a naïveté and
freshness that stamp them at once as genuine and
uncoloured.</p>

<p>The translation of Forkel was followed after a
long interval by a volume based partly upon it,
partly upon a sketch written by Hilgenfeldt as a
centenary memorial in 1850. Though presumably
edited by the late Mr. Rimbault, whose initials are
appended to the preface, the abstract is so unfaithful
and illiterate as to be practically without value. The
third biography to which I have alluded is of a different
character; it is a plain and conscientious abridgement
of the work of C. H. Bitter, now minister of finance
in Berlin, and only to be laid aside in view of the more
complete materials which have been made accessible to
us by Professor Spitta, and in the later publications of
the Bach-Gesellschaft.</p>

<p>Dr. Spitta’s “Johann Sebastian Bach,” published
at Leipzig in two volumes in 1873 and 1880, represents
the many years’ study of a professed musician.
For all the facts of Bach’s life, and all the obtainable
data relative to his works, it is a final and
exhaustive treasure-house. Nothing can be more
scientific and workmanlike than the method with
which he has exhumed and collected every detail from
every source that might possibly bear upon his subject,
and nothing more admirable than the warm enthusiasm
which lights up his work. Practically he has left hardly
anything for further research, nothing certainly that
could be made use of in a short sketch like the present.
When, however, I state that my facts are mainly due to
him, I do not wish to imply his responsibility for a
single word not covered by this admission. In
criticism I give exclusively the results of an independent
study of Bach’s works, which I have pursued for
a number of years. Nor am I sure that Dr. Spitta
would invariably approve of my arrangement of his
facts, and especially of the extent to which I have drawn
from the personal narrative of Forkel. In many
respects, a small book demands a different treatment
from a large one, and I have not restricted my freedom
of choice in a sketch that can never by possibility
enter into competition with Dr. Spitta’s work. My
best wishes for it are that it may serve the modest aim
of preparing a worthy reception for his English translation
which is shortly to appear.</p>

<p>It would be affectation to conceal the great help in
the composition of this volume which I have had from
my wife, not merely in the selection of material, but
even more in the judgment and taste with which she
has controlled my writing.</p>

<p class="center f2">SEBASTIAN BACH.</p>

<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>It is never without interest to seek out the beginnings
of genius in a great man’s forefathers. The
mere tracking of pedigrees has an attraction for more
than will willingly confess to what is reputed mainly
an innocent weakness of old age. The pursuit, however,
gains in dignity when it is not only the kinship
but also the intellectual growth of the family,
not only the blood but also the soul, with which we
have to do. In no family, perhaps, is it of greater
moment than in that of Sebastian Bach, wherein his
special tastes and powers all have their prophecy and
preparation in a tradition where everything is musical.</p>

<p>From the first years of the sixteenth century&mdash;so
soon, in other words, as the arising of a national
religion has revealed to us the life of the German
people&mdash;we have already traces of Bachs scattered
among the valleys of Thuringia. There are Bachs
near Arnstadt, in Erfurt, and Gotha, and Wechmar,
places hereafter to be remembered in the musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">Pg 2</a></span>
vocations of their descendants. The ancestor of
Sebastian appears, a little later, as a baker of Wechmar.
This Veit Bach († 1619), named from Saint
Vitus, the patron of the church there, is related to have
passed some years in Hungary, and to have gone back
to his home when the rigour of dominant Jesuitism made
living in Hungary hard and perilous. We may here
note the sole basis for the common story that the
family of Bach was of Hungarian descent. Veit sold
his goods and set up as a baker, and then as a miller,
in his native village. <i>He had</i>&mdash;so Sebastian tells the
tale&mdash;<i>his chief delight in a little cithara</i> (Cythringen),
<i>which he would take with him into his mill and play
thereon while the corn was grinding. They must have
sounded merrily together! Howbeit, so he learnt the
sense of time; and in this wise music first came into his
house.</i> But music had already a professor among the
Bachs, and it was to Caspar Bach, the town piper of
Gotha, that Veit entrusted his son Hans.</p>

<p>Hans Bach, <i>player</i> and carpet-weaver, whose portrait
was taken with a fiddle and a <i>brave beard</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and
ornamented with a fool’s cap, returned from his
apprenticeship in his double craft, to settle at Wechmar,
where he lived until 1626, when the plague
killed him, with many of his kinsfolk, in middle life.
His was a blithe personality, in great request in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">Pg 3</a></span>the places round, as much, it seems, for his hearty
goodfellowship as for the help he gave the town
musicians wherever he went. To three of his large
family, which included apparently three Hanses and
certainly two Heinrichs, he handed down, with a part
of his open generous nature, that musical inheritance
which in their hands grew into an artistic possession
rich with the promise of greater fruit. It is worth
while to stay a moment at this point to observe how
deep roots music had struck into the family of Bach.
For it seems that Hans had a brother whose three
sons shewed sufficient excellence for the Count of
Schwarzburg-Arnstadt to send them into Italy that they
might complete their artistic training. Another son
became the ancestor of a continuous succession of
musicians, the last of whom, fourth of his line holding
office in the ducal court of Meiningen, died organist
there in 1846. Among this branch Johann Christian,
distinguished as <i>Clavier</i>-Bach, a music-master at
Halle, deserves commemoration from his friendship
with Wilhelm Friedemann, the son of Sebastian, if
only to illustrate the bond which held together the
most remotely connected members of the family.</p>

<p>The household at Wechmar was broken up at the
death of Hans, and the three brothers, Johann,
Christoph, and Heinrich, separated to form new homes
in other parts of Thuringia. But the intercourse of
themselves and of their children was never in the
least relaxed. They married into the same families,
helped one another in sickness or poverty; the
younger members were apprenticed to their elder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">Pg 4</a></span>
kinsfolk and often succeeded to their posts when they
died; and the yearly gatherings of the entire family
held their ground for a century. The closeness
of this attachment merits insisting upon especially,
when we consider the troubled times on which the
family was thrown at its first dispersion. For the
thirty years’ war in its wearisome progress makes the
outward history of Germany, in the second quarter of
the seventeenth century, little more than a record of
battles and sieges, with scant breathing-spaces of
peace, not long enough for the towns to recover from
exhausting occupations of foreign troops. In this age
of continued misery the foundations of German society
seemed to be gradually undermined. A struggle,
which added to the confusion of civil war the passion
of religious hatred, threatened to dissolve the natural
bonds of the family and of the race. Men sank into
a blind and listless state, abandoning themselves to
any vice or excess that seemed to deaden the thought
of the morrow. It was therefore amid every circumstance
of adversity that the Bach family grew to its
full stature; and it is the more noteworthy that the
latest, most learned, and most laborious biographer of
Sebastian is unable to furnish a single evidence, in
the entire records of his kindred, of the least deflection
from the straitest paths of virtue.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Johann Bach, the eldest of Hans’s family with whom
we have to do, was apprenticed to the town piper of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">Pg 5</a></span>Suhl, whose daughter he afterwards married, and
whose son he came in time to welcome as a pupil and
a kinsman in his house. He became organist at
Schweinfurt, and ultimately director of the town
musicians at Erfurt. It was a hard time, this of war,
for musicians; but they had their meed of glory&mdash;and
profit&mdash;when any peace festivities came. And Johann
Bach seems to have made himself indispensable, like
his father, in all the musical affairs of the place. He
began, in fact, a line of musicians so indissolubly
bound up with the life of the town, that more than a
century later, when all the house was extinct, the town
musicians of Erfurt still retained the generic title of
"the Bachs." Adding to the duties of town musician
those of organist to the Dominican church, he becomes
a prominent forerunner in the two paths in which the
genius of his family was to reach its climax. His
home, also, lying equally accessible to Arnstadt and
Eisenach, remained for long the centre of the greater
family of the Bachs in general. It was in Johann
that his youngest brother, Heinrich, found a guardian,
when he was left an orphan in his twelfth year.
Heinrich was not only the greatest musician of his
generation, but also specially his father’s son in that
kindliness and merry temper which made him as much
the delight of his family as he had been of his father
in his boyish days. He played in the Erfurt band
until he gained the post for which nature and training
had fitted him, as organist at Arnstadt, a post which
he retained with increasing honour and distinction for
above half a century. Of his organ works little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">Pg 6</a></span>
remains, but we have the accordant testimony of his
contemporaries to place him among the greatest
organists of his time. An equal agreement acknowledges
his genial lovable nature, in all its freshness
and childlike gaiety, which it was beyond the power
of adversity to embitter or to corrupt.</p>

<p>Johann and Heinrich married sisters. Both had to
pass through their times of misfortune, and Heinrich’s
first years of marriage were also years of great poverty.
The pittance allowed him by the town of Arnstadt
was irregularly paid, or not paid at all, in consequence
of the immense drain upon the resources of Germany
made by the continued&mdash;it seemed, the endless&mdash;war.
Heinrich had to sue as a beggar to the Count of
Schwarzburg. But no trouble made either of the
brothers waver in their warm-hearted generosity to
their kin or in their earnestness in their calling. They
lived in the honourable esteem of the Thuringian towns
wherein they dwelt, and left behind them a new generation
to carry on and to exalt their fathers’ art and
name. Each left two sons; and, by a curiously repeated
custom, each of these pairs of brothers married
sisters. Renown first came to the younger branch,
and the skill and learning with which the sons of
Heinrich were informed remains a monument of their
father’s powers, as distinct and certain as if he were
still known to us as a composer. Johann Christoph
and Johann Michael are an astonishing phenomenon
in this mid-time of national depression. Their
writing has a freshness and vigour which seems to
carry us back to the beginning of the seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">Pg 7</a></span>
century, when the spirit of Germany was strong and
creative, or forward to the age following, when the
people had again recovered its strength. Of the
greater achievements of the latter time the work of
Johann Christoph and Michael appears as a prelude.
In the pedigree of Sebastian Bach they fade to a comparative
obscurity; viewed by themselves they are
luminaries of signal brilliance. Johann Christoph
was more than a complete master of the musical
science of his day; he was also one of the first who
ventured to deviate from the rigid rules of the early
contrapuntists, to make them freer, more flexible, and
more significant. He is a link between ancient and
modern music, blending the old church modes with
the modern tonality of major and minor. Besides this,
he marks an important step in the growth of dramatic
music. His Michaelmas piece, <i>The Fight with the
Dragon</i>, follows in the track of those Germans who
had invented the idea of setting to music scenes from
Biblical history, Schuetz and Hammerschmidt; but it
goes far beyond them in command of the orchestral
body, and in the genius of dramatic utterance. The
sacred drama is, in his hands, clearly on the road
which leads to the perfected oratorio of Handel or the
no less perfected Passion music of Sebastian Bach.
But the permanent interest of Johann Christoph Bach
lies, even more than in his historical significance, in
the beauty of his melodies and the <i>expressiveness</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">Pg 8</a></span>which he wrought them. It was Sebastian, his cousin
in the next generation, who first knew how to appreciate
his great predecessor. Contemporaries, however,
were attracted rather by Johann Michael. But,
excellent musician as he was, and gifted with a fine
artistic sense, Michael failed specially in that power
of expression which signalized his brother. The
motets by which he is best known are deficient in
symmetry. The ideas they contain are irregularly
worked, and appeal to us by isolated beauties rather
than by the unity of their spirit. The performance
lags behind the conception. Of the instrumental
works of the two brothers, works principally for the
organ, and also for clavichord, there is not space to
speak here. It is enough to have indicated in bare outline
their general position. Their external history need
only so far detain us as to notice that the elder was
organist at Eisenach, the younger at Gehren near
Arnstadt, and that Michael’s daughter became the
wife of her cousin Sebastian.</p>

<p>The musical faculty grew to ripeness more rapidly
in the family of Heinrich Bach than in those of either
of his brothers. Johann’s sons were of course musicians,
but composition first appeared in a grandson, Johann
Bernhard, a man of wide capacity. He was cembalist in
the Duke of Saxe-Eisenach’s band, and of such distinction
as an organist, that he was chosen to succeed to
the post of his illustrious cousin, Johann Christoph, at
the latter’s death. He holds an honourable rank as a
composer, having written orchestral suites as well as
the proper productions of his office, organ-chorales.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">Pg 9</a></span>
The latter follow somewhat directly in the steps of the
famous organist of Erfurt&mdash;afterwards of Nuernberg&mdash;Johann
Pachelbel, whose influence is indeed paramount
over all the Bachs of his time. The orchestral works,
however, have overtures which are described as equal
in power and energy to some of those to Handel’s
operas and as only surpassed in genius and richness
by Sebastian’s own. They have the peculiar interest
of existing mostly in the autograph of the latter, who
transcribed and esteemed them at the period of his
greatest maturity when he was cantor at Leipzig.</p>

<p>Leaving the rest of the musician-posterity of Johann
and Heinrich Bach&mdash;and hardly a place in Thuringia
or even Saxony but claimed some of them whether as
organists or cantors, or in the minor arts of town piper
or fiddler&mdash;we return to the brother who stands
between them in age, and who is the grandfather of
Sebastian. Christoph Bach, who was born at Wechmar
in 1613, is the most secular of the sons of Hans. He
was simply and solely a <i>player</i>, first in the service&mdash;menial
as well as musical&mdash;of the Duke of Saxe-Weimar;
then at Prettin in Saxony, where he took to
him a wife; and thirdly, when he was near thirty, in
the Company of Musicians in the more familiar town
of Erfurt. His last years were spent in the band of
the court and town of Arnstadt, where he died at the
age of forty-eight, on the 14th September, 1661, his
widow following him on the 8th of the next month.</p>

<p>Georg Christoph, his eldest son, of whom a concerted
piece of church music was long preserved in the family,
retreated in middle life from the immediate circle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">Pg 10</a></span>
the Bachs; he became cantor at Schweinfurt, and
founded the Franconian branch of the continually
expanding house. Next to him came two sons, twins,
Johann Ambrosius and Johann Christoph, born on the
22nd of February, 1645. The coincidence of their
birth was, in their case, accompanied by an almost
unique identity of physical nature, character, and
taste. The brothers were so alike that their own
wives could not tell them apart: both adopted the
family profession, and both the same instrument, the
viol. Their strange psychological affinity subjected
the one with the other to the same illnesses; and the
elder survived the younger by little more than a year.
Johann Christoph is the subject of one of the few
detailed narratives which we encounter in the history
of the Bachs before Sebastian; and this, if it does not
seriously damage his reputation, equally does not credit
him with the prudence that is characteristic of his kin.
It appears that an indiscreet though innocent friendship
with one of the Arnstadt maidens, accompanied, most
rashly, with an exchange of rings, brought upon the
young fiddler a prosecution at the hands of his would-be
mother-in-law. The consistory, it is presumed, urged
amends by the marriage of the parties; but Bach was
firm&mdash;this is a family trait&mdash;and appealed to the higher
consistory at Weimar, from which at length he
obtained release from his difficulty. An experience of
this sort made him hesitate before he finally decided to
take a wife; and, after his marriage, misfortune&mdash;not
of his own making&mdash;followed him for some years more.
His place in the Arnstadt band was harassed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">Pg 11</a></span>
jealous persecution of the principal town musician.
The Bachs of Erfurt and Arnstadt combined in a
memorial in his favour, but nothing came of it. In the
end the Count dismissed the entire band <i>for indolence
and disunion</i>. Christoph, in his poverty, still helped
his uncle Heinrich in the Sunday music of his church;
but this brought no subsistence to his household. He
was fain to go to Gehren, <i>if he might but do some
service with quiet music, whereby to support himself and
his family in their need</i>. The death of the Count at
last brought them rescue, for his successor restored
Bach to the posts of court musician and town piper.
From this time, 1682, the musician lived in peace; but
his death eleven years later left a legacy of new
troubles to his widow and her five children, the eldest
just ten years of age. They had a long time of poverty
and sickness to struggle with, though the boy, Johann
Ernst, did his best to gain a living for them in the
family craft. But he was a poor musician, and fortune
kept him waiting. Ultimately he got the
organistship at Arnstadt vacated by Sebastian, who,
himself ill-provided and on the point of marriage, left
Ernst the arrears of his salary and ended his kinsman’s
days of trouble.</p>

<p>Johann Ambrosius, the brother of the unlucky
Christoph, has a meagre record. He was attached to
the town band of Erfurt, afterwards of Eisenach; and
married twice. His first wife, Elisabeth, daughter of
Valentin Laemmerhirt, a furrier of Erfurt, gave him
eight children, of whom six were sons. Three of these
only grew to man’s estate; the youngest is the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">Pg 12</a></span>
of the present study. Ambrosius’ second marriage
was followed in two months by his death, in January,
1695. Of his character we have but one solitary
notice, when a funeral sermon on a weak-minded sister
gave occasion to the preacher to mark the contrast
with her two brothers: <i>whom we see to be men of a good
understanding, endowed with art and skill, who are well
seen and heard in churches and schools, and in the
common life of the town, in such wise that the work
praiseth the Master</i>. A portrait of Ambrosius, which
looks down upon the precious reliques of his son in the
Berlin library, is notable not only for its likeness to
Sebastian but also for the simplicity of its manner.
There he is, not sprucely dressed out for the occasion
in wig and powder, but in plain working clothes, with
brown hair and moustache. There is a certain pride
in this disdain of outward decoration.</p>

<p>Before closing the recital of the genealogy of the
Bachs, a word of notice is claimed by the Companies of
Players that existed in Germany in their time, and
with which they necessarily stood in close relation.
The regulations of these fellowships are in some cases
preserved, and are interesting memorials of the pious
care which their framers took to guard against the
abuses to which the musician’s craft was peculiarly
exposed, to inflict the sternest penalties on profligate
or irreligious conduct, and to exclude the singing or
accompanying of any but virtuous music. It does not
appear, however, that any of the Bachs belonged to
such a company. Many of them held a better worldly
position, most were better educated than the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">Pg 13</a></span>
town player. It is a plausible inference that their
number alone served to constitute them an informal
guild by themselves, of which the name was that of
their family, and the only regulation that which sprang
from the generosity of their nature and the close ties
which knit the kin together in a common pride and
emulation in their common art. Emanuel Bach,
Sebastian’s son, has left us a genial picture of how the
kinsmen would gather all together, at Erfurt, or
Eisenach, or Arnstadt, once in the year, and there
make merry. First they sang a chorale; and, this duty
ended, soon turned to a medley of secular songs. The
climax was reached in the <i>quodlibet</i>, when all joined in
a sort of comic chorus. The music consisted of any
scrap, no matter whether sacred or profane, that
occurred to any of the assembled company. It was an
improvised catch. Each man in turn gave his own
part or refrain, all different and all in harmony. The
words were as incongruous as the music, and every one
added his own quip or jest to the general jollity. Such
was the homely festival that held its place in the family
life of the Bachs as late as the middle years of
Sebastian’s career.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>Johann Sebastian Bach was born at Eisenach on the
21st March, 1685.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The Thuringian town had been a
home of the Bachs ever since the two sons of Johann
Bach had found their wives there. Two of the family,
and no less men than Johann Christoph and Johann
Bernhard, had successively filled the post of organist in
the town church. The death of his parents, however,
before he had completed his tenth year removed
Sebastian from the surroundings that seemed so fitted
for the training of his genius. Already he was his
father’s apt pupil on the violin, and the music which
was the daily occupation of the house was not lost
upon the eager ears of the child. He passed from
Eisenach into the care of his brother Johann Christoph,
his elder by fourteen years, who was organist in the
little town of Ohrdruf; and it was here, in one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">Pg 15</a></span>most beautiful of the valleys of Thuringia, that the
rest of his boyhood was passed. The impression of
this country of soft hills and warm wooded valleys
became a part of Sebastian’s nature and still lives in
his music. The least attentive listener cannot mistake
the inclination to a pastoral treatment which is
continually appearing not in the professed <i>Pastorales</i>,
as in the <i>Christmas Oratorio</i>, merely, but throughout
the compass of Bach’s works; still more striking is his
vein of idyllic melody, peculiarly obvious in the fine
gold into which he transmuted the baser metal of the
Italian <i>aria</i>, to illuminate his church cantatas.</p>

<p>At Ohrdruf Bach lived until he was fifteen, learning
the clavichord from his brother, who was a pupil of
Pachelbel, and apparently exciting his jealousy by the
facility of his progress. A story of him tells us that
he once coveted a book containing compositions by
several of the great German masters, Froberger,
Bruhns, Pachelbel, and Buxtehude; but the obtuseness
of the elder brother forbade his venturing into studies
too high for him. So the boy went every moonlit
night to the cupboard in which it was shut away, and,
thrusting his hand into the lattice, rolled up the
volume and stealthily made his copy of it. However,
when the deed was discovered, this labour of half a
year was taken from him and not restored until after
his brother’s death.</p>

<p>If Bach’s musical discipline at home left much for
him to find out by himself, his education at the
Ohrdruf Lyceum proceeded fairly enough and in music
excellently. He learned Latin and the Greek Testa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">Pg 16</a></span>ment,
with a little arithmetic and rhetoric. Of these
subjects indeed Latin only had any pretence to
thoroughness, and, although its range of reading did
not extend beyond Cicero and Cornelius Nepos, it
included a good deal of composition both in prose and
verse. Very different was the musical instruction of
the Ohrdruf school, which qualified the boys to furnish
all the choral music of the church, besides singing
motets and <i>concerts</i> at weddings and funerals.</p>

<p>Five years of this routine, and Bach left Ohrdruf.
There was little more to be learned from his brother,
who, with a family of his own, was no doubt glad to
be rid of his charge. Accordingly he travelled, with
a comrade of the school, to Lueneburg, and the lads
together joined the choir of the Michaëlisschule. It
seems that Thuringian boys were in special request for
their musical training, as well as for the remarkable
quality of their voices; and Bach’s proficiency on the
violin and clavichord, added to his fine treble, placed
him at once in the select <i>Matin</i> choir.</p>

<p>Lueneburg at this time enjoyed a wide repute
throughout North and Middle Germany for the goodness
of its musical training. There were two schools
belonging to the churches of S. Michael and S. John,
and the rivalry was so keen between the scholars
that, when in winter time they perambulated the town&mdash;like
the rude manner of our waits&mdash;it was necessary
to mark out the road which each should take to avoid
an unseemly wrangle. This custom of itinerant choirs,
however bad for the singers’ voices, was of service in
quickening the popular sympathy with music; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">Pg 17</a></span>
the rivalry itself was useful in stimulating the
ardour of the colleges. The principal work of the
school of S. Michael’s was to prepare the music
for the choral services of its church, two on Sundays,
with motets and anthems, and, above all, high
services with orchestra on the eighteen feast-days
of the Lutheran kalendar. These formed the business
of Bach’s life for three years. Some employment in
playing or in the training of the choir must have
occupied him after his voice changed, for he continued
to take his commons at the free board until 1703.</p>

<p>All this time his general education was carried on
much after the Ohrdruf pattern, with a rather wider
circle of Latin authors, the Greek Testament, divinity,
and logic. Higher than this the course did not go;
and Bach had not the means, if he had the wish, to
engage private teaching there, or to proceed to one of
the universities. We shall see hereafter that he
obtained an exemption from the classical work of the
Thomasschule at Leipzig. At Lueneburg poverty conspired
with his natural impulse to keep him closely to
the profession as well as to the study of music. It
was the period of his apprenticeship in the three
branches in which he was afterwards to achieve a
supreme excellence. At the Michaëlisschule he gained
an intimate knowledge of the capacities of choral
singing; he worked at the organ; and he became
acquainted with the lighter instrumental music lately
brought to Germany from France.</p>

<p>The organ claimed his chief and unremitting labour,
and more than once did he journey to Hamburg to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">Pg 18</a></span>
attend the performances of Reincke, the father of
North German organists. Old Reincke, as he is
affectionately known&mdash;he lived well into his hundredth
year and died in 1722&mdash;was a pupil of Sweelinck and
one of the channels by which the learning and method
of the great Amsterdam organist was diffused through
the entire length of Northern Germany. From the
dexterous and graceful toccatas which still attest
Reincke’s powers Bach probably derived little; the
principal reward of his Hamburg visits was the
insight he acquired into the scope of organ composition,
a lesson which he so worked out as to receive
(according to a well-known story) the honourable
testimony of the master himself. <i>I thought</i>, said
Reincke, when, just before the old man’s death,
Bach elaborated before him the chorale <i>An Wasserflüssen
Babylons</i> in the true organ style, <i>I thought
that this art was dead, but now I see that it lives in
you</i>.</p>

<p>Bach stood in a closer connexion with a pupil of
Reincke, Georg Boehm, organist at S. John’s Church,
Lueneburg, and also a distinguished composer. In
chamber-music as well as in the organ Bach learned
much from him, but more in the manner of instrumental
treatment and in the theory of composition,
than by any direct influence on his writings. At this
time also he made acquaintance with French music
at Celle, where it had been naturalised forty years
since and was now in its prime at the court of Duke
Georg Wilhelm and his Huguenot consort Eléonore
d’Esmiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">Pg 19</a></span></p>

<p>A further training in instrumental music was
afforded by the post which Bach held for some months
after leaving Lueneburg, in 1703, in the band of
Prince Johann Ernst at Weimar. But he could not
long be content with the limited scope of a court
violinist; and a chance visit to Arnstadt, where his
grand-uncle Heinrich had founded a tradition of organ
playing, but, dying eleven years before, had left no
worthy successor, offered to Bach the opportunity of
following out his special bent. An organ had recently
been built in the new church of the town, but the
burghers had not yet succeeded in finding a musician
who satisfied their notion of the importance of the
post. The man they had engaged they watched so
jealously that he was not even trusted with the keys
of his loft: one of them was deputed to receive them
back from him as soon as playing was over. It is
significant of the skill which Bach had already won,
that he no sooner tried the organ&mdash;it does not appear,
as a candidate&mdash;than the consistory welcomed in this
lad of eighteen the musical heir of their honoured
town organist, dismissed the incapable Boerner, and
forcibly installed Bach at a triple salary augmented
out of the municipal chest. On the 14th August,
1703, he took the solemn pledge of diligence and
faithfulness and all <i>that appertaineth to an honourable
servant and organist before God and the worshipful
Corporation</i>.</p>

<p>The brilliancy of Bach’s reception at Arnstadt was
transient. The New Church was a sort of chapel-of-ease
to the principal church of the town; and Bach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">Pg 20</a></span>
was only entrusted with the training of a small, partly
voluntary, choir. His duties accordingly engrossed
but a couple of hours on three days of the week, and
the townspeople were well satisfied if he did not fall
short in them. In this languid atmosphere he found
no incitement to convince the town, by his performances,
how far his hopes and ambitions exceeded
those of the ordinary organist. He seems in time to
have been content with a bare fulfilment of his duties,
or hardly that, and to have concentrated himself in his
private studies. After two years the respite of a
month’s leave enabled him to visit Luebeck, the home
of the illustrious organist Buxtehude; and hither a
long walk of fifty leagues brought him in November,
1705.</p>

<p>As Reincke was a Dutchman, so Dietrich Buxtehude,
who did as much, on his own lines, to establish
the North German school of organists, was a Dane.
He had settled in Luebeck in 1660, and the enthusiasm
with which his art was attended was such that his
influence remained in the town until the present century.
One of the causes of his popularity was the custom
which he innovated of having concerts, with a full
orchestra of uncommon strength, in his church. A
deeper reason was his consummate command over
the organ and the important advances he made in
composition.</p>

<p>Buxtehude stands apart from the organ composers
of the rest of Germany, in the greater technical
elaboration of his works. In spirit he has a single
point of alliance with the organists of Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">Pg 21</a></span>
Germany, in his want of sympathy with, his estrangement
from, the chorale, in which the music of Middle
Germany had its life. The melodic richness which
this training in popular music developed in Pachelbel
and Johann Christoph Bach was lacking in Buxtehude.
His strength lay in pure instrumental music and was
displayed specially in fugue-writing, to the development
of which he contributed much, both in the
combination of several themes in a fugue and in the
extended function he assigned to the pedal. The form
is conceived with breadth and freedom, the voices are
melodiously worked together, and the harmonies are
unusual in their originality, often so unusual as to
seem merely discordant, harsh, restless. For if the
works of Buxtehude strike one first by the massiveness,
they strike no less by their inequality, their
strange, erratic transitions from a sombre, often
tempestuous, mood to one of tenderness and pathos.</p>

<p>It was at the feet of this rugged genius that Bach
sat for three months; and the impress left upon his
mind was distinct and durable. His fastidious censorship
in later years allowed very little of his Arnstadt
work to survive. A single church cantata comes
down to us in the shape to which a careful revision at
Leipzig reduced it<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>; but several instrumental works
let us see how far he had advanced in composition, and
two organ fugues,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> at least, how much he needed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">Pg 22</a></span>education of these months at Luebeck to complete the
studies hitherto influenced by the school of Pachelbel.
The subjects in them are ingeniously constructed, but
the entire compositions are deficient in relief and
coherence. They shew the earnest spirit in which he
worked, but also that this earnestness acted as a weight
upon the freedom and brightness of the result. Outwardly
he retires under the established musical forms
of his time, but even now his individuality forces itself
into view. An instance of his technical immaturity is
afforded by his treatment of the pedal, which, according
to the universal custom except in Northern Germany,
Bach used merely occasionally, limiting it to the production
of sustained notes or at the most of slow
progressions.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Buxtehude, on the other hand, changed
it from a capricious accessory into a real support to
the manuals and often entrusted it with a brilliant
<i>solo</i> part. In this important element of organ composition,
his Luebeck visit opened a new road to Bach
and a road which he was not slow to follow.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>The clavichord works that occupied his leisure at
Arnstadt seem, to judge from the few specimens that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">Pg 23</a></span>have come down to us,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> to have been chiefly of that
sort of free fugue, sometimes with a humorous design,
to which it was the custom to give the name of
<i>capriccio</i>. In one of them, a sonata (No. 216, p. 12),
a fugue of the most melodious conception is followed
by a <i>capriccio</i> founded on the cackle of a hen; <i>Thema
all’ Imitatio Gallina Cucca</i> is the macaronic title.
Another (No. 208, p. 30) portrays the feelings and the
circumstances attending the departure of his brother&mdash;<i>sopra
la lontananza del suo fratello dilettissimo</i>&mdash;Johann
Jakob, who went as hautboy-player in the
Swedish guard of Charles XII. We have the sad
gathering of the family, and their recitals of the perils
that may befall the traveller in a strange land. They
seek in vain to stay him, and, finding him resolute,
join in a general <i>lamento</i>&mdash;a fine composition, by the
way, written upon two ground-basses, and tenderly
pathetic&mdash;ere they take leave. When the slow fare-*well
is ended, the postilion makes his appearance, and
the sorrow of the departure is exchanged for the lively
bustle of the road, the picture ending gaily with the
post-horn deftly worked into a fugue.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> This curiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">Pg 24</a></span>elementary form of what it is the fashion to call programme-music
may appear to have been suggested by
the fantastic compositions of Couperin and others,
which Bach heard at Celle. But, in this regard at
least, the old German Froberger was another Couperin.
He is recorded to have written a suite depicting the
<i>Journey of the Count of Thurn and the Peril that came
to him on the Rhine, plainly delivered before eye and
ear</i>. Probably, however, Bach’s immediate reference
is to a work that had recently been published by
a musician whom in after-life he was to succeed
as cantor at Leipzig. Johann Kuhnau’s <i>Biblische
Historien</i> are scenes from the history of the children of
Israel presented in a series of sonatas for the clavichord.
To judge by their contents it is likely that Bach
took the idea of this <i>capriccio</i> from them, but it is
significant of his insight into the unsatisfying nature
of the peculiar style, that he never returned to it,
unless indeed we admit a kindred basis in the rare
examples of the imitation of outward emotion, which
appear in his Passion music.</p>

<p>When Bach returned home from Luebeck, in
February, 1706, his month’s holiday having expanded
into three, he not unnaturally encountered the displeasure
of the authorities. Summoned before the
consistory, he excused himself on the ground that
<i>he had been to Luebeck with the intent to perfect himself
in certain matters touching his art</i>, and, having provided
a substitute for the time, he was under no misgivings
as to the discharge of his duties at Arnstadt. But
heavier charges lay behind. He was to be rebuked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">Pg 25</a></span>
(to quote the pedantry of the official record) <i>for that he
hath heretofore made sundry perplexing variations and
imported divers strange harmonies, in such wise that the
congregation was thereby confounded. In the future</i>,
continues the Minute, <i>when he will introduce a</i> tonus
peregrinus, <i>he is to sustain the same and not to fall
incontinent upon another, or even, as he hath been wont,
to play a</i> tonus contrarius. A witness added that <i>the
organist Bach hath at the first played too tediously;
howbeit, on notice received from the superintendent, he
hath straightway fallen into the other extreme and made
the music too short</i>. Evidently he had brought things
into a bad way, for the next charge is, that he refused
to train the choir. Bach retorted by demanding a
conductor. He was allowed time to consider whether
he would comply with the order of the Board or leave
them to appoint some one to fill his place. Under the
circumstances it shows a surprisingly gentle temper in
the consistory, possibly a just appreciation of their
organist’s great, however capricious, excellence, that
they waited near nine months before they repeated,
with some severity, the demand for an explanation.
Bach agreed to furnish one; but the document has
unfortunately not been preserved. It is evident, however,
from the indifference with which he treated the
consistory, as well as from his unwillingness to fulfil
the conditions of his post, that he had already decided
to resign it on the first opportunity.</p>

<p>The opportunity was not long coming: before the
end of the year the organist’s place at S. Blasius’
Church, Muehlhausen, fell vacant. A succession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">Pg 26</a></span>
distinguished musicians and the various eminence of
the last holder of the post, Johann Georg Ahle&mdash;perhaps
also the fame of the <i>poet’s crown</i> with which
the Emperor had decorated him&mdash;made the office an
exceptionally coveted one. Among the various candidates,
however, it was adjudged apparently without
debate to Bach, who was even requested to make his
own terms as to the salary he should receive. He
modestly stipulated the same sum as he had been
allowed at Arnstadt&mdash;it was indeed considerably in
excess of Ahle’s salary&mdash;together with the accustomed
dues of corn, wood, and fish, to be delivered without
charge at his door. He asked also for a cart to bring
his goods to his new house.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> These trifling details
are oddly characteristic of the man, and remind us of
a letter he wrote long after to a relative, thanking
him for a cask of wine, but quoting the expense of
carriage, and begging that the costly present might
not be repeated. Just at present he had a special
reason for thrift. He left Arnstadt by the end of
June, 1707; in the following October, the 17th, he
was married at a village near Arnstadt, to his cousin
Maria Barbara, daughter of the great Gehren organist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">Pg 27</a></span>Johann Michael Bach. A single year after his appointment
he accepted the more ambitious post of organist
in the Ducal Chapel at Weimar.</p>

<p>His short stay at Muehlhausen had been pleasant and
useful to him. He entered upon his work, which was
purely that of organist, with ardour, and&mdash;in contrast
with his lax performance of his duties at Arnstadt&mdash;even
took a share in the training of the choir, although
there was a cantor as well. The only drawback was
that the pastor of his church was a strenuous pietist,
one of those puritans who found, not a spiritual gain,
but a worldly intrusion upon the sacredness of divine
worship, in those church cantatas which it was Bach’s
work to create anew. The organist held to a close
friendship with his pastor’s hot antagonist at the
Church of S. Mary, and seems to have gone into the
neighbouring villages whenever he wished to produce
music upon which he could not venture in his own
church. This can hardly have been, however, the
principal reason of his leaving Muehlhausen so quickly
as he did. The charges of married life made his
stipend barely a maintenance, even without a family.
He had had enough of the subordination of a town
organist. But most of all he must have been stimulated
by the renown of the music at Weimar, with
which he had become acquainted in an inferior capacity
four years before, and the wide field it promised
for the cultivation of his art in all its departments.
On the 25th June, 1708, he respectfully submitted his
resignation to the consistory. Their answer, requesting
that his departure should not hinder his continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">Pg 28</a></span>
to supervise the repair of the church organ with which
they had entrusted him, is evidence of the good terms
on which they separated.</p>

<p>For the next fifteen years Bach stands in a circle of
greater honour, removed from the small troubles of a
town official. His return to a burgher’s life in 1723&mdash;and
at Leipzig he was never free from the harass of
the wiseacres of his consistory&mdash;may surprise us, unless
we conclude that the experience of his intervening
years had taught him that if the delights of life came
more liberally in the atmosphere of a court, a great
town was after all the place for him who would live
laborious days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>Passing from Muehlhausen to Weimar was to Bach as
the step from school to a university. The nine years
of his life there produced works in which almost any
other musician might glory as the perfect consummation
of his powers; but when we range them beside
the performance of Bach’s middle life, we see that all
this time was still a period of preparation. Wonderful
indeed is this strenuous preparation, carried on with
increasing earnestness to his thirty-second year; this
prelude to a life-long study&mdash;the index of the faithful
artist&mdash;which was never relaxed until sight and
strength forsook him. And no less wonderful is the
growth of his genius&mdash;when we look back upon his
earlier performances&mdash;revealed in rapid stages from
the beginning of his sojourn at Weimar. But it was
not only the years that had come upon him, but also the
opportunity they brought with them, that make this
change so marked an epoch in his life. Little as we
know of the court of Weimar, there are some facts
about its condition at this time which let us see that
its intellectual atmosphere could not have been without
its excitement and inspiration to Bach.</p>

<p>The Duke, Wilhelm Ernst, was a man of naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">Pg 30</a></span>
grave and religious character. It is told of him that
at eight years old he preached a sermon before his
parents and their company; and in later life his chief
pleasure and occupation lay in building churches,
organizing religious schemes, and founding schools.
In the troubles of an unhappy marriage and the approach
of a childless age, his serious temper deepened
into austerity. But, if always averse from gaiety or
the least approach to the wonted dissipations of a
court, he was a good friend to arts and letters; and
the forty-five years of his rule began the tradition of
culture which led up to the historical era in the annals
of Weimar a century later. He founded the library,
had a collection of coins, and&mdash;what is more to our
purpose&mdash;took a strong and pious delight in hearing
and fostering the music in the castle chapel.</p>

<p>The strict and sombre discipline which the Duke
imposed upon his homely court&mdash;it went to bed, we
are told, at eight in winter, and only an hour later in
summer&mdash;was relieved by the brighter influence of his
brother, Johann Ernst, the prince with whom Bach
had taken service as a violinist in 1703. He died in
1707, but his son, also Johann Ernst, inherited his
father’s taste for the chamber-music of France and
Italy, and showed himself in his short life a composer
of promise. The boy liked to be surrounded by
musicians, to take lessons from them, and hear his
favourite music. At the present time there was a
brilliant circle at Weimar, and in this the prominent
figures were the town organist Walther, known for
his <i>Musical Dictionary</i>, and Bach. A famous story
connects the two. Bach, we are told, had boasted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">Pg 31</a></span>
his ability to play anything at first sight, and Walther
determined to baffle him. He asked him to breakfast,
and, knowing Bach’s habits, laid among the music
upon the clavichord a piece of simple and innocent appearance.
While the meal was making ready the
host leaves the room. Bach comes upon the piece,
tries it and halts, begins again, and breaks down.
Then he leaves the instrument in exasperation, shouting
to his friend, <i>No, one cannot play everything off:
the thing is impossible</i>.</p>

<p>Of the routine of Bach’s life at Weimar we can only
gather the outline. He held the double post of
organist and <i>musicus</i> in the court. The latter function
involved in Bach’s case either taking a fiddle in the
orchestra&mdash;a band of sixteen performers all attired in
a grotesque uniform of Hungarian heyducks&mdash;or accompanying
from the <i>basso continuo</i> on the harpsichord
(<i>cembalo</i>). When after some years he was appointed
concertmeister he of course took the place of first
violin. He was now required to supply a certain
number of church compositions; and the age of the
capellmeister often added to his duties the task of
conducting. The series of church cantatas written
at this time&mdash;among which the magnificent one, <i>Ich
hatte viel Bekümmerniss</i>, stands preëminent&mdash;are sufficient
evidence of the energy with which he applied
himself to his additional duties. If we ask how
he lived in his household&mdash;and no man lived more
than Bach in the life of his home&mdash;we are answered by
a blank. We have not even a clue as to the manner
of woman his wife was. Six of her seven children
were born at Weimar, and two, twins, died there in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">Pg 32</a></span>
1713. The names of the sponsors to them show the
varied popularity Bach had gained among the different
ranks with whom he was thrown. Pages in waiting
and a Muehlhausen clergyman appear beside Bach’s
kinsfolk or his professional comrades&mdash;Telemann is
among them&mdash;or the humbler associates of his early
life at Ohrdruf or Arnstadt. His continually increased
salary&mdash;it never indeed exceeded some thirty pounds,
added to the usual perquisites paid in kind&mdash;is one of
the many signs of his being valued. More significant
is the request he was in as an organist throughout
Saxony, and even in a wider circle. He was always
being invited to try or inspect organs, to play at
different courts and attend musical celebrations, till it
came to be a yearly practice with him to break the
busy monotony of his Weimar life by a holiday spent
in answer to these various calls. Some accounts that
remain of these journeys are the more interesting
since they are the only record, outside his compositions,
of these years.</p>

<p>In 1713 he was at Halle, and so much attracted by
the quality of a new organ then building as to offer
himself for the organistship. The consistory eagerly
accepted him, and Bach composed a cantata on the
spot, and brought it out as a testimonial. The documents
of office quickly followed him back to Weimar
for signature. But Bach was dissatisfied with the
terms, possibly the Duke had persuaded him to stay
at the castle; in any case, he wrote a courteous letter
asking for some changes in the conditions of the post.
The church authorities were indignant, refused to alter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">Pg 33</a></span>
a word in the agreement, and hinted, quite falsely,
that Bach had merely played with them in order to
get an increase of pay at Weimar. Bach wound up
the correspondence by a vigorous and dignified defence
of his action; and it is pleasant to know that peace
was tacitly re-established by Bach’s accepting a
flattering invitation to play upon that same organ on
its completion in 1716.</p>

<p>Another autumn journey of Bach took him to
Cassel (1714), where he played a pedal solo on the
organ, a feat of miraculous agility, which few, one
relates, could equal with their hands. The hereditary
prince, who was present, took a precious ring from
his finger and expressed by the oriental gift his admiration
of the performance.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Other years Bach went to
Leipzig, perhaps to Meiningen, and his excursions from
Weimar end with the celebrated visit to Dresden.
Just before this, in 1716, Mattheson, one of the most
influential musical critics of his day, had asked for
his biography, and wrote of him as <i>the renowned organist</i>;
in the following year his mere name vanquished
a redoubtable harpsichord-player, Marchand, who had
never before been confronted by an equal. The
Frenchman was so popular at the Dresden court that
some friends of Bach in the orchestra there seem to
have induced the German master to stand forward in
defence of his national music. It is certain that a
challenge was sent to Marchand, and that a large
company awaited the contest of the pianists in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">Pg 34</a></span>house of one of the royal ministers. Bach was there,
but not Marchand. After long expectation, a messenger
at last was sent to his lodging, only to bring
back the news that he had left Dresden by express
post that morning. No defeat could be more decisive,
especially when we remember that Bach’s fame had
hitherto rested upon his consummate powers as an
organist. It may be added that he was so far from
being prejudiced by his personal relations with
Marchand that he always valued the gracefulness and
exuberant variety of the French composer; and
Adlung, who tells the story, says that he only once
was able to appreciate his music, and that was when
Bach played it to him. Success never affected
Bach’s judgment: his generosity was always without
vanity.</p>

<p>In leaving Weimar in 1717, Bach ceased for ever
to be by calling an organist, though the instrument
remained always his chief delight, and once at least he
was tempted again to resume it as a profession. As a
performer he seems to have grown every year in
mature strength. In 1720, when he visited Hamburg,
his performance at S. Katharine’s Church was attended
by the aged organist, Reincke, and an assemblage of
many of the principal men of the city. How he impressed
Reincke has already been related, and no doubt
it was partly the enthusiasm with which he was greeted
that made him view Hamburg as a congenial home for
him. An organistship was vacant at one of the other
churches there, and Bach directly offered himself for
the place. He had to leave before the trial of the
candidates took place, but was so eager for the ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">Pg 35</a></span>pointment
that he wrote from Coethen to repeat his
willingness to accept it. The post as it turned out,
was given to the man who paid the highest premium,
and Mattheson was not the only man in Hamburg who
expressed indignation at <i>the well-to-do tradesman’s son,
who could prelude better with dollars than with fingers</i>,
being preferred to the <i>great virtuoso whose mastery
excited the admiration of every one</i>. Neumeister, who
was chief preacher of the church, took occasion to
remark in a sermon just after, that <i>he was sure enough
that if one of the angels who sang at Bethlehem were to
come down from heaven and play divinely and desire to
be organist of S. James’s, nevertheless if he had no money
he might as well fly back again straight</i>.</p>

<p>There are constant and innumerable proofs, besides
the few we have noticed, of the impression Bach made
as an organist: not the least striking among these is a
note by Gesner, with whom Bach was closely connected
in later years at Leipzig, illustrating a musical
passage in Quintilian. After describing in vigorous
rhetoric the almost superhuman powers of his friend,
he adds, <i>Though none can surpass me in my support of
the ancients I opine that many Orpheuses and twenty
Arions are comprehended singly in my Bach and any, if
such there be, like to him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> The characteristics which
gave Bach his quite unique position as an organist are
partly those of an extraordinary originality in the
application of the mechanical resources of the instrument.
How minutely he knew its structure is shewn
by the frequency with which he was chosen, almost
from boyhood, to pronounce upon the necessity and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">Pg 36</a></span>detail of repair in organs, and to judge the success of
the result. His arrangement of stops before he played
was so singular as to make <i>connoisseurs</i> absolutely
incredulous of the possibility of so producing harmonious
combinations, but when he began the doubt was
changed into amazement at the swiftness, the precision,
and the power of his movements both of feet and
hands. If, however, a by-stander expressed astonishment,
he would silence him with quiet modesty. <i>There
is nothing to wonder at in that</i>, he would say: <i>you have
only to touch the right key at the right time and the instrument
plays itself</i>. As a rule he gave the pedal a real
part of its own, often of incredible difficulty; and by
this means he left his hands free to develop the theme
in the broadest manner, and to apply the stops, each
as it appeared most appropriate and characteristic,
with wonderful insight and ingenuity. He liked also
to use the pedal to announce a tenor part whenever
(as was the case at Weimar) he could find a four-foot
register. Of difficulties he seemed unconscious, and
this was equally true when he was elaborating a simple
bass or a chorale, or improvising a fugue, as when he
was playing from a written score. Indeed Forkel, who
knew Bach’s sons, relates that “his unpremeditated
voluntaries on the organ, where nothing was lost in
writing down, are said to have been still more devout,
solemn, dignified, and sublime,” than those which stand
in record of his supreme command of the instrument.
Forkel instances Bach and the son to whom his gifts
were transmitted in a special measure, Wilhelm Friedemann,
as solitary examples of consummate skill equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">Pg 37</a></span>
on clavichord and organ. “Both,” he says, “were elegant
performers on the clavichord; but when they came to
the organ, no trace of the harpsichord-player was to be
perceived. Melody, harmony, motion, &amp;c., all was
different, that is, all was adapted to the nature of the
instrument and its destination. When I heard Will.
Friedemann on the harpsichord, all was delicate,
elegant, and agreeable. When I heard him on the
organ, I was seized with reverential awe. There, all
was pretty; here, all was grand and solemn. The
same was the case with John Sebastian, but both in a
much higher degree of perfection. William Friedemann
was here too but a child to his father, and most
frankly concurred in this opinion.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>I have already taken occasion to trace the studies by
which Bach prepared himself to become the greatest
organ composer as well as the greatest organist of all
time. At the present break in his life it will be
convenient to give a summary account of his total
production in this department,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> though it must be
little more than an enumeration of the works that
survive; since organ music least of all lends itself to
any but a scientific analysis, such as would be altogether
out of place here. My references are to the compositions
contained in the <i>Fifth Series</i> of Peters’ collected
edition of Bach’s instrumental works.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">Pg 38</a></span></p>

<p>Bach’s organ works divide themselves into three
great branches, the first of which is connected most
closely with his religious office. It is well known that
the German chorale since the days of Luther has always
held its regular place in the service of the church.
This form of melody, however much more beautiful, is
essentially the same with what we in England used to
sing as psalm tunes, at a time when one metrical
version of the Psalter was employed and the modern
hymn with its new words and heterogeneous structure
had not yet made its voice heard. In Germany
words and music were alike familiar to every one; they
formed in fact the nucleus of Lutheran worship both
in church and at home. We shall see hereafter how
Bach collected two hundred and forty chorales for use
in his household; and there are hardly any of his
church cantatas which do not contain at least one. In
church, whenever a chorale was announced, every one
present could be trusted to sustain the melody, and it
was allowed to the organist to vary the harmonies
almost to any extent he pleased without fear of confusing
the people.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> In this way it came to be a recognised
part of the organist’s function, at least in Middle
Germany, to adorn the simple grandeur or pathos of the
chorale by means of preludes, interludes, and variations,
generally improvised at the moment; and this treatment
of chorales was so popular, through the influence
of Johann Christoph and Michael Bach, Pachelbel, and
a number of leading organists just before Sebastian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">Pg 39</a></span>Bach’s time, that it became extended so as to form the
basis of independent instrumental compositions, for use
at other intervals in the church service. It was a
custom of which Bach was peculiarly fond, giving him,
as it did, a firm groundwork, with high associations,
upon which his fancy could build with the utmost
freedom. And though he wrote down but a minute
part of what he composed, we possess in print no less
than a hundred and thirty elaborations of chorales
(parts 5-7), besides twenty-eight of which the genuineness
is disputed (suppl. 9-36). They range from
short and slight preludes to works of the most intricate
brilliancy, abounding in all the science as well as in all
the melodious art of which Bach was master. Those to
whom the organ chorales are inaccessible may learn
their spirit by unravelling the harmonies he has used
in the fivefold setting of one chorale in the S. Matthew
Passion or from other no less remarkable instances in
that according to S. John, to quote only from works
which are best known in England. The inexhaustible
invention which is pressed into the brief compass of
these verses, is in the organ-chorales distributed over
a long composition; but the extension is never for the
purpose of display, and the fundamental motive insistently
maintains itself throughout.</p>

<p>In opposition to these the second branch of Bach’s
organ works stands remote from the church. It was
not choice only but also the determined bent of musical
taste at Weimar that directed his study again to the
instrumental music of Italy; and the influence for the
present lay strongly upon his organ music as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">Pg 40</a></span>
upon the rest of his compositions. Three of Vivaldi’s
violin-concertos with a movement of a fourth (part 8,
1-4) he arranged for his instrument; he wrote fugues
on themes by Legrenzi and Corelli<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> (4. 6, 8), and a
fugue and <i>canzone</i> (8. 6; 4. 10) recalling the manner of
the great Roman organist, Frescobaldi, whose <i>Fiori
Musicali</i>, published in 1635, he possessed.</p>

<p>But it would be a great mistake to imagine that
Bach was at this time engrossed by the Italian masters.
On the contrary Weimar was the place where he wrote
the bulk of his organ works of the third branch, the
preludes, fantasias, toccatas, and fugues, in which his
strong religious sense united with his power of musical
creation to build up masterpieces of a perfection never
approached either before or since. The list of his
works of this period is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Three <i>Preludes</i>, in A minor, C, and G (4. 13;
8. 8, 11):</p>

<p>2. Three <i>Fugues</i>, in G minor, C, and G minor (4. 7;
8. 10, 12):</p>

<p>3. Fifteen <i>Preludes and Fugues</i> in A, F minor, C
minor, G minor, E minor, C, G, and D; besides a collection
of eight shorter ones (2. 3, 5, 6; 3. 5, 10; 4. 2,
3; 8. 5. i-viii.):</p>

<p>4. Three <i>Toccatas and Fugues</i>, in F, C, and D minor
(3. 2, 8; 4. 4):</p>

<p>5. Two <i>Fantasias and Fugues</i> both in C minor (3.
6; 4. 12): to which must be added three single works,
namely a <i>Fantasia</i> in C (8. 9); a <i>Pastorale</i> in F (1. 3);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">Pg 41</a></span>
and the superb <i>Passacaglio</i> in C minor, well known to
all organists worthy of the name (1. 2).</p>

<p>For the years succeeding those he spent at Weimar,
Bach has left us, with one grand exception, no certain
record on the organ; we shall see hereafter that he was
otherwise occupied. But there is hardly a doubt that
he took advantage of the exceptional opportunity
offered by his Hamburg visit in 1720, to produce his
famous <i>Fantasia and Fugue</i> in G minor (2. 4). It does
not surprise us to find that the Fugue, which English
musicians have personified as the Giant, left an abiding
impression among the listeners.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> As we possess it, it
has undergone a rigorous revision, to which, in common
with the major part of his younger works, Bach afterwards
submitted it when at Leipzig.</p>

<p>Accordingly the short series which he is believed to
have composed in later years does not represent more
than a fraction of his activity in this direction; since
revising in his case usually meant re-writing, certainly
re-thinking. The compositions which are presumed to
date originally from the year 1723 onwards, consist of
seven <i>Preludes and Fugues</i>, in C, G, A minor, E minor,
B minor, E flat, and D minor,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> (2. 1, 2, 8, 9, 10; 3. 1,
4), and a <i>Toccata and Fugue</i> in D minor, known as the
Doric toccata (3. 3); together with six <i>Sonatas</i> written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">Pg 42</a></span>to exercise the growing skill of Bach’s eldest boy,
Wilhelm Friedemann (1. 1).<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to characterise in a few words the
works which gave Bach his chief renown among contemporaries,
and the familiarity of many of the greatest
of them renders such an attempt unnecessary. It may
suffice to direct attention to the majestic motion of the
august Passacaglio, as contrasted with the idyllic grace
of the Pastorale which follows it in the printed edition,
and which remains lamentably a fragment;&mdash;to the
broad directness of the Fugue in C (2. 1), the daring
invention of the longest of the fugues, that in E minor
(2. 9), which proceeds almost entirely by chromatic
intervals, the irresistible charm of the G minor, or the
marvellously varied solemnity of the E flat, naturalised
in England as the S. Ann Fugue. It is as an organ
composer that Bach stands, as a colossus, absolutely
unapproached and unapproachable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">Pg 43</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p>The reasons which determined Bach to leave Weimar
are not quite clear. He was in fact one of those quick-tempered
men whom a small irritation might kindle
to a resolve of disproportionate gravity. In the present
case he had a real grievance in the appointment of a
son as successor to the old capellmeister, whose work
Bach had done for a long time and the reversion of
whose office he might reasonably have counted upon.
Leopold, the reigning prince of Anhalt-Coethen was no
stranger at Weimar. A family alliance connected the
two courts, and it is likely that he had heard Bach
there. In any case Bach was known to him by report,
and in 1717 was invited to take the post of capellmeister
at Coethen.</p>

<p>The six years that Bach spent in the service of this
prince make a kind of pause or breathing-space in his
life. It is not that he was idle during this period: his
work was different. He had, as it were, stepped aside
from the road upon which he had journeyed all the
years of his manhood, to follow a by-lane where he
might loiter if it pleased him. And if this short abandonment
of his peculiar art, dedicated to the service of
the church, in favour of the writing of suites for strings
or clavichord, hardly needs apology, it remains re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">Pg 44</a></span>markable
that Bach consented to take a position in
which church music or even organ-playing had no
place. In no one of the three churches in Coethen
had he any control; perhaps he was not sorry in the
present case, since two of them, with the bulk of the
population, belonged to (his special aversion) the reformed
or Calvinistic sect.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> The Castle Church could
boast but an indifferent organ and was unprovided
with a choir; so that even had Bach wished to overstep
the limitations of his duty, there were no opportunities,
but rather discouragement, in Coethen for him to
return to his old work.</p>

<p>He was designated Capellmeister and Director of his
Highness’s Chamber Music, but in the peculiar situation
of the Coethen court the title imperfectly describes
the nature of his post. Leopold was a young bachelor
who gave to music the loving worship he had not yet
consecrated to a woman. He cultivated his art with
an eager enthusiasm, sang a full bass, and was no
mean performer on violin, viola-da-gamba, and clavichord.
He welcomed Bach as a brother in the craft,
and not only employed him to compose for his varied
requirements, but took him into his familiar fellowship,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
played with him, sang with him, insisted on his company
whenever, as was his habit, he journeyed abroad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">Pg 45</a></span></p>

<p>Before this he had learned some knowledge of the
world, had travelled in England and Italy, and made
acquaintance with the music of Rome and Venice. For
the future we find him and Bach making repeated
visits to Karlsbad and other distant places, and the
obedient capellmeister sometimes perhaps a little
<i>ennuyé</i>, if we may credit a story which relates that on
one of these journeys he consoled himself for the lack
of all musical instruments by striking off the greater
part of the <i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i>. The incongruous
performance recalls the tale of the famous printer,
Henry Estiennes, that he divided the New Testament
into verses, the verses which we still retain, on a ride
from Paris to Lyons.</p>

<p>In spite of the widened experience, it was in truth a
narrowing life to Bach. He was not one of a musical
group as at Weimar; there is no record of his having
any friends in the place. If he had the pleasantness of
the grateful appreciation of the Prince, he had no
public to sustain his ambition. His days were divided
between his house and the music-room of the castle;
and he only came into contact with the musical society
outside by the custom which he still maintained of
employing his holiday in the autumn to visit towns
where he was known, where he was invited to try organs
and exhibit his skill, or to produce occasional cantatas.
Once he went to Leipzig to prove the new organ at
the University Church, another time, as has been
already mentioned, to Hamburg. Once again he
travelled to Halle in the hope of making Handel’s
acquaintance, but just missed him.</p>

<p>A visit with Prince Leopold to Karlsbad in 1720,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">Pg 46</a></span>
was sadly memorable to Bach. For while he was on
his way home and no news could reach him, his wife
suddenly fell sick and died. He arrived only to learn
that she was already buried. How deep a grief this
was to the family&mdash;the mother was but thirty-five&mdash;we
know from the recollection of it which the second son,
Philipp Emanuel, then a child of six, bore more than
thirty years later. His tender, flexible nature reflected
hers closely, as his elder brother Friedemann’s robust
vigour did that of his father. And the fact that the
two most striking figures, as also the most musical,
among Bach’s twenty children sprang from this marriage
may be taken in evidence of the near sympathy
subsisting between the parents. Else we know nothing
of Maria Barbara, and one is apt to depreciate her by
comparison with the more gifted woman whom Bach
chose for his second wife.</p>

<p>His care was now mainly for the children, four of his
seven alone surviving their infancy. The eldest was a
daughter, Katharina Dorothea, whom we shall hereafter
meet again as helping with her voice in the family
concerts; then came three sons, the two already
mentioned, and Johann Gottfried Bernhard.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> It was
Wilhelm Friedemann, now a lad of ten, who claimed
his father’s most anxious attention; and never was a
charge fulfilled with greater love and willingness. In
later life Bach’s relation to him was one of intimate
friendship; already the promise of his musical skill
aroused the keenest hopes of his father. He showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">Pg 47</a></span>afterwards that he had all the characteristics of Sebastian
accentuated: stolid independence was carried into
wilful obstinacy, hotness of temper into a confirmed
irascibility, morose when not violent. At present he
was only the hopeful eldest son, for whose sake Bach
developed a complete scheme of musical training,
beginning with a <i>Clavier-Büchlein</i> of easy pieces, as
early as January, 1720. There is an air of tenderness
for the small fingers he loved, and longed to educate, in
the ladder of difficulties he so carefully constructed, and
in the little preface, <i>in nomine Jesu</i>. This was followed
by <i>Inventions</i> in two and three parts, designed to
cultivate an equable strength and free motion in all
the fingers. The title was apparently chosen to indicate
that beyond this he sought to teach in these pieces the
elements of musical taste, <i>invention</i> in the scholastic
sense being a compound of just disposition of the members
and appropriate expression.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> The third stage in
the course of instruction was constituted by the preludes
and fugues of the <i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i>, in which
technical execution is combined with beauty of form
and expression, each in its finest development. One of
the points on which Bach insisted was that the practice
of the clavichord should from the outset go hand in
hand with composition. He assumed that no one should
learn to play who could not <i>think musically</i>, as he
expressed it; and he never allowed a pupil to compose
at the instrument. He would not, he said, have him
to be a <i>piano-hussar</i>, a taunt that might well be
taken to heart by some of our modern composers. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">Pg 48</a></span>parallel system of training for the organ was also
primarily intended for Friedemann; and both alike
shew the clearness and penetration with which Bach
understood the functions of a teacher.</p>

<p>In after-years the rector of his school at Leipzig,
between whom and Bach there was no love lost, said of
him that he was a bad teacher and could not keep order
in class. The latter is likely enough, and the former may
not be without foundation in the particular case. A man
of Bach’s extreme sensibility would certainly appear at
his worst in the irritating surroundings of a rude
schoolroom. That he could teach, however, and
teach better than any man of his time, is proved by
the string of distinguished names that appear among
his scholars and by the unbroken succession of pupils
whom he had in his house from his marriage almost to
his death, the applicants increasing in his later days
until he was continually forced to turn them back.
To his chosen pupils he was kind and genial, and full
of encouragement. <i>You have five as good fingers on
each hand as I have</i>, was his answer to complaints of
difficulty. He never set himself up as a model to
which others could not attain: <i>I was obliged</i>, he would
say, <i>to be industrious; whoever is equally industrious
will succeed as well</i>. From these glimpses of his bearing
we may readily conceive the love and enthusiastic
reverence which he aroused in his pupils, and as for
his irritability, the common failing of great artists,
experience shews that at least it does not make a man
a bad teacher in private, however much it may militate
against his success in a school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">Pg 49</a></span></p>

<p>Bach did not remain long a widower. The tradition
of his ancestors contained no law requiring a year of
mourning; indeed his father married again in seven
months. Sebastian was more patient, waited nearly
a year and a half, and chose wisely. His new wife,
Anna Magdalena Wuelken, held a position as singer
at the Coethen court; her father was trumpeter in
that of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. She was
twenty-one, fifteen years younger than her husband.</p>

<p>The marriage, which took place on the third of
December, 1721, was entirely happy. Anna Magdalena
proved herself no mere <i>hausfrau</i>, but a real
companion to Bach in all his tastes, a helper in work
and a sharer in all his pleasures. She had a fine
<i>soprano</i> voice, for which her husband delighted to
arrange songs and recitatives. Often she copied them
out for herself, and besides this her clear well-formed
hand, closely resembling Bach’s, occurs constantly in
the collections of his manuscripts. On his side he
helped her to master the clavichord. Two <i>Clavier-Büchleins</i>,
written for her, exist in his autograph, and
to judge by their handsome bindings and the inscriptions
in them, were intended as gifts to her, one
just after their marriage, in 1722, the other in 1725.
She used and added to them afterwards as a sort of album.
They contain a great part of what we now know as
the French suites, with a variety of preludes, arrangements
of airs from his cantatas, &amp;c., and also a set of
rules for thorough-bass. It is plain that if the one
was an indulgent teacher, the other was a ready and
diligent pupil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">Pg 50</a></span></p>

<p>The beginning of Bach’s new happiness was soon
attended with an unexpected drawback. Prince
Leopold married a week after his capellmeister, and
from this time forth his interest in music declined.
His wife, so unlike Bach’s, cared nothing for music
the concerts were still attended, but no longer listened
to, and Bach’s work became more and more irksome
to him. He had no outside public to take the place
of the now indifferent court. He continued, however,
for a year, until the death of Kuhnau, the learned and
original cantor of the Thomasschule at Leipzig, offered
to him an opportunity of returning to that work in the
service of the church for which he must have longed
all these years. He left Coethen in the summer of
1723, having first composed two church cantatas, as
evidence of his fitness for the post. It is probable
that, in the hope of the election taking place before
Easter, he wrote the <i>S. John Passion Music</i> to grace
his arrival, as though to prove that the divorce from
sacred music which he had supported for so long a
time had made his fertility and creative force only
the more abundant. But the delay of the Leipzig
authorities postponed the production of this masterpiece.
By a coincidence the Princess of Coethen, the
determining course of Bach’s removal, died just before
he left. Perhaps for the moment he regretted the
step he had taken: to us that step is the most
fortunate act in his life and the herald of his greatest
triumphs.</p>

<p>As we considered the Weimar time as representative
of Bach’s career as an organist, so Coethen is the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">Pg 51</a></span>
of his most extensive production for the clavichord, for
the chamber, and for the orchestra. We may therefore
here enumerate the compositions that belong to
these classes, reserving for the present the great
collections of fugues contained in the <i>Wohltemperirte
Clavier</i>, of which the second half falls under a later date
when the first was alone entirely rearranged and partly
rewritten, and the <i>Kunst der Fuge</i> which was the
achievement of Bach’s last years.</p>

<p>The clavichord works admit of a double classification.
On the one hand we have independent
compositions, of which the idea is mostly derived from
the organ-style; on the other stand the <i>suites</i>, or sets
of pieces in dance-measures, which are moulded upon
Italian models. Both alike are adapted by Bach to
the clavichord in such a manner that they are completely
naturalised in their new-found country. To
the former class belong the following works arranged
in conformity with Dr. Spitta’s critical results; the
numbers refer to <i>Peters’ cheap edition</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>A.</i> <span class="smcap">Weimar Period.</span></p>

<p>1. Four <i>Fantasias</i>, in D, A minor, G minor, and B
minor (211, p. 28; 215, pp. 3, 30; 216, p. 9):<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>2. Four <i>Toccatas</i>, in E minor, D minor, Gr minor
and major (210, pp. 3, 30; 211, p. 4; 215, p. 17):</p>

<p>3. Six <i>Fugues</i>, two in A, and two in A minor (212,
p. 10; 216, p. 20; 212, p. 14; the fourth in MS. at
Berlin), together with two, in A and B minor, on
subjects taken from Albinoni (216, p. 25; 214, p. 12):</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">Pg 52</a></span></p>
<p>4. One <i>Prelude and Fugue</i> in A minor (211, p. 14):
to these we may perhaps add the well-known one in
B flat of which the subject is on the (German) notes
contained in the name Bach (B flat, A, C, B natural)
but of which the genuineness is suspicious (212,
p. 24).</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Coethen Period.</p>

<p>1. A <i>Fantasia</i> in C minor (212, p. 2).</p>

<p>2. Four <i>Fantasias and Fugues</i>, in D minor (the
famous <i>Chromatic Fantasia</i>), B flat, and D (207, p. 20;
212, pp. 28, 32).</p>

<p>3. Two <i>Toccatas</i>, in F sharp minor and C minor
(210, pp. 10, 20.)</p>

<p>4. A <i>Prelude</i> in C (printed among the organ works,
series v. 8. 3), and two sets of twelve and six little
preludes for beginners (200, pp. 3, 14).</p>

<p>5. Five <i>Fugues</i>, in C minor, two in C, and two in
D minor (200, pp. 20, 22, 24; 212, pp. 3, 5).</p>

<p>6. Four <i>Preludes and Fugues</i> in D minor, E minor,
and two in A minor (200, pp. 26, 28, 33; 207, p. 36).</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Leipzig Period.</p>

<p>Two <i>Fantasias and Fugues</i> in A minor and C minor
(208, p. 22; 207, p. 32 and 212, p. 22, the two parts are
separated in the edition).</p>

<p>To this list must be added the two sets of <i>inventions</i>
(201) written at Coethen; and the four great <i>Duets</i>
(208 p. 36) in which the idea of the invention (or
<i>sinfonia</i>) is treated on a much larger scale.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> The duets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">Pg 53</a></span>were written at Leipzig, and it has always been
claimed that no skill could possibly add a third real
part to them.</p>

<p>In a similar intermediate position stand the two
sets of <i>Variations</i>, one in A minor, a Weimar composition,
headed <i>alla maniera Italiana</i> (215, p. 10),
the other a great series of thirty variations in G, of
which notice will be taken in connexion with Bach’s
life at Leipzig (209).</p>

<p>The <i>Suites</i> begin at Coethen with the six so-called
<i>French Suites</i> (202) and three single sets which probably
belong together (214, pp. 18, 26, 32). A solitary
suite, in F, bears traces of having been written
at Weimar (215, p. 25). At Leipzig Bach produced
six <i>Great Suites</i>, known as the <i>English</i> (203, 204),
and an equal number of sets of <i>Partitas</i> (205, 206).
Another partita of the same period, in B minor, is
known from its opening as the <i>French Overture</i> (208,
p. 4).<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>At Coethen Bach also wrote three sonatas, in A minor,
C, and D minor (213, pp. 2, 16, 24), with a fourth which
remains only a fragment (212, p. 18).<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> These sonatas,
the title being to some extent interchangeable with
<i>suite</i>, have little in common with the form to which
Bach’s son Philipp Emanuel, Haydn, and Mozart (Beethoven
can of course not come into the comparison) developed
it. The parent of this exists also among
Bach’s works, but it has a different name, being dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">Pg 54</a></span>tinguished
as the <i>Italian Concerto</i> (207, p. 4). It is
remarkable that it should bear a designation properly
true of an orchestral composition, as though in prevision
of the unlimited development of which the
form was susceptible.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> But the feeble internal resources
of the clavichord, Bach’s chosen instrument
for study&mdash;the harpsichord was too hard, and the
infant pianoforte too coarse for him&mdash;prevented him
from himself following up the conception. He preferred
to write music which was independent of so
imperfect an exponent; and his clavichord works are
characterised by freedom and delicacy of melody, infinite
fancy, and, as we see specially in his fugues, the
fullest solidity and richness of structure, rather than
by any effects which need a responsive sympathy in
the instrument. It is as such that we ought to judge
them, however much their life is broadened by performance
on the piano.</p>

<p>It is difficult to separate Bach’s chamber compositions
from those for orchestra. The orchestras of that
day were very small, that at Weimar consisted but of
sixteen performers, and Bach’s matured scheme for
the production of his church music at Leipzig asked
only for a band of twenty. It is wholly uncertain
how far it was usual, or considered necessary, to
multiply with the parts; in any case chance might often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">Pg 55</a></span>reduce the small orchestra to numbers more consistent
with chamber music. That this happened in the concertos
which Bach conducted in his own house we may be
pretty sure. There is, therefore, little objection to
our enumerating both forms of composition in one
section.</p>

<p>The <i>Concertos</i> are written on various scales, the use
of one instrument <i>concertante</i> being extended to <i>Concerti
Grossi</i> requiring as many as four. For the harpsichord
there exists six; for two harpsichords two, and
for three again two. In another concerto he has combined
the harpsichord with two flutes, and in two
more with flute and violin, as the three <i>obbligato</i>
instruments.</p>

<p>For the violin Bach composed three concertos, besides
one apiece for two violins, for violin and hautboy,
for two flutes and violin, and for flute, violin, hautboy,
and trumpet.</p>

<p>Orchestral works, but for an orchestra of very
various constitution, are three of the so-called <i>Brandenburg
Concertos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> and four <i>parties</i> or suites which rank
among the most flexible and melodious of all Bach’s
creations.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The list would be increased by nearly
thirty works if we added the instrumental symphonies
which occur in the course of his cantatas.</p>

<p>As strict chamber music we may reckon his three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">Pg 56</a></span>sonatas or trios, in which the harpsichord combines
respectively with two flutes, flute and violin,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> and two
violins. For harpsichord and flute there are six
sonatas; for harpsichord and violin a like number,
together with three separate pieces, a sonata, a partie,
and a fugue; finally, three sonatas for harpsichord and
viola-da-gamba.</p>

<p>The list of Bach’s instrumental works is completed
by two sonatas for obsolete instruments, one for the
lute, the other for his own invention, the <i>viola pomposa</i>,
and by the memorable sets, of six sonatas each, for
the violin and violoncello, which are well enough
known in England to render an account of them
superfluous.</p>

<p>But a few words are needed in conclusion to mark
Bach’s position in reference to the clavichord. In the
first place, being acutely sensible of the least falsity
of tune, he always tuned the instrument himself, a
process which never cost him more than a quarter of
an hour. In this art he introduced a great reform,
that of tuning on a basis of equal temperament.
Without such a reform his chromatic music, and
notably his <i>Chromatic Fantasia</i> and the <i>Wohltemperirte
Clavier</i>, would have been impossible. Another instance
of his fastidious taste is that no one but himself
could adjust the quills of a harpsichord to his satisfaction.
He took great pains in improving the action
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">Pg 57</a></span>of the clavichord, and invented a new instrument,
the lute-harpsichord (<i>lauticlavicymbel</i>), with a surprising
brilliancy of tone; but the difficulty of tuning
it led to its abandonment.</p>

<p>It would demand too technical a discussion if we
were to analyse the method of playing which Bach
introduced. That he was the first to insist upon an
equal use of the thumb with the rest of the hand, and
to act upon the principle that touch proceeds from the
lower joints of the fingers, and not from the wrist or
arm, makes him the founder of the modern art of
piano-playing. It is said of him that he “played with
so easy and small a motion of the fingers that it was
hardly perceptible. Only the first joints of the fingers
were in motion; the hand retained, even in the most
difficult passages, its rounded form; the fingers rose
very little from the keys, hardly more than in a shake,
and when one was employed, the others remained still
in their position. Still less did the other parts of his
body take any share in his play, as happens with many
whose hand is not light enough.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> His playing was
light, smooth, swift&mdash;powerful or expressive, as he
chose&mdash;but always without display or the appearance
of effort.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>For near forty years Bach’s history had followed the
common course of the musicians of his generation,
and he had reached what was then held the most
dignified rank in his craft. He had passed through
the stages of chorister, orchestral violinist, and
organist: he was now capellmeister in a ducal palace,
and, measured by conventional standards of success,
he had nothing further to look for or to desire.
Least of all was it to be expected that he would
descend from this dignity to the position of a school-teacher
and precentor in the less select atmosphere of
a trading town. Success, however, held a small place
in Bach’s mind in comparison with anything which
should forward his highest artistic aims, consistently
with his own honour and integrity; and the confined
circle of activity in the chapel at Coethen could satisfy
but a part of his complete musician’s nature. The
years of study and the years of ripe performance must
be completed by a period of broadened influence
exerted in the arousing of the musical soul of a great
town, and in the foundation of a school of disciples of
his own spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">Pg 59</a></span></p>

<p>In the spring then of 1723 Bach quitted a life
which had become ungrateful to him since the duke
had tired of his devotion to music. One reason for his
leaving&mdash;and this perhaps was decisive&mdash;was, that he
might do his best for his children’s bringing up. His
care was always for Wilhelm Friedemann, his eldest
and best-loved child; and in this very year we find
that he entered him as a student at the university
of his new home. In reviewing his life seven years
later Bach touches upon all these considerations which
took him from Coethen to Leipzig.</p>

<p>The school of S. Thomas in this town, where Bach
was called to fill the post of cantor, was an ancient
foundation, already in its fifth century of existence.
Once belonging to the Augustinian Canons of the
Thomaskloster, it combined music and general teaching,
like other conventual schools of the middle ages.
In this shape it survived the reformation: it remained
both a choir-school and a grammar-school; and of its
seven masters, the cantor, who took a middle place,
lowest of the four <i>superiores</i>, had his share of both
branches of teaching. He gave a certain number of
lessons a week in music and Latin grammar, varied on
Sunday evenings by the Latin catechism of Luther.
Bach, however, was allowed to pay one of his colleagues
to take the Latin teaching from him&mdash;less, it is to be
presumed, from incapacity than from disinclination or
perhaps from diffidence; so that, except when his substitute
was ill, his occupation was solely musical. His
formal declaration of office bound him to treat the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">Pg 60</a></span>
humanely, and to instruct them as well in instrumental
as in vocal music.</p>

<p>But the work in school was the least portion of the
cantor’s task. He had the musical oversight&mdash;as we
should say, he was precentor&mdash;of the two chief
churches of S. Thomas and S. Nicholas; he had to
provide a choir for the simpler service at S. Peter’s;
and he had also a more undefined control over the
New Church (S. Matthew’s). Among these four churches,
and apparently, on festivals, in the extra-mural church
of S. John too, the cantor had to distribute his choir.
The best-trained voices were reserved for S. Thomas’s
and S. Nicholas’, where the services were so arranged
that the cantor could preside over the important music
at both. The other churches had to be content with
the younger and more unskilled choristers. All of
them the cantor supplied with music&mdash;<i>not too long
or too operatic</i>, was the special injunction when Bach
entered office. He had to be ready with special services
for high days, weddings, and funerals, which last
he was directed to attend in person. Finally, he had
to supervise the different organists, the fiddlers and
pipers&mdash;the embryo orchestra&mdash;of the town.</p>

<p>It was this commanding position, of <i>Director of
Music</i> of the great town of Leipzig, rather than that
of teacher in the Thomasschule, which drew Bach
from the ease and quiet of his ducal chapel. How
little it was realised at the time of Bach’s arrival, we
shall soon see. In the first place, the school itself was
just then at the last period of decay. It had long
suffered from the blunders of its rector, Johann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">Pg 61</a></span>
Heinrich Ernesti, a solemn man, clergyman and
pedant&mdash;he was Professor of Poetry in the university&mdash;who
had lived his seventy years without learning the
first secret of acquiring influence over masters or
scholars, far less of giving unity or vigour to the
management of the school. There was discord everywhere,
with its usual accompaniment. The attendance
of the scholars fell off, in the lower classes to less than
half their former number; and, worse than this, their
quality deteriorated in equal stages: the best pupils
drifted away to Lueneburg, and the Leipzig school
threatened to sink into a mere training-place for
people who were to make their livelihood by singing
at funerals. Yet every attempt to reform it was
thwarted by the timid obstinacy of its rector; and it
was not until his death, when Bach had been under
him for six years, that any effectual measures for its
revival were possible.</p>

<p>An even greater obstacle to the prosperity of the
school lay outside it; for, since the first years of the
century, the institution of the opera had established a
separate centre of musical training and musical interest
in the town. The new importation gained a sudden
popularity and success when it came under the hands
of Telemann, afterwards famous as organist at Hamburg.
The Opera became a dangerous rival to the
School; and the rivalry was the keener since Telemann
was organist of one of the churches that drew their
choirs from S. Thomas’s. If the cantor was mortified
at the retrenchment of his authority, it was the school
that suffered the most. For its scholars at first spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">Pg 62</a></span>
their holidays in the opera-company; soon the choir
of the New Church was absorbed into it. The boys
went over altogether, willing enough to abandon the
restraints and the severer training of the school, for
the freedom and gaiety, not to say the profit, of the
career now open to them. And, although Telemann
left Leipzig after a year (1705), the Musical Society
(<i>Musikverein</i>) which he founded went on growing and
flourishing at the expense of the school. The music
at S. Thomas’s had to be kept down to the diminished
capacity of its voices. Difficult works could only be
attempted with a certainty of failure. Even the Town
Council, usually blind to the faults of old endowments,
came to see the fruitlessness of helping any pretence of
reform on the part of a school which produced results
so inferior to the unendowed performances at the
New Church.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of affairs when Bach came to
Leipzig: the whole musical life of the place seemed to
be dying away in disunion and mismanagement. The
very opera which had ruined the Thomasschule ceased
to exist in 1726; the Musical Society founded by
Telemann had passed into incapable hands; and, to complete
the chaos, the University organ and the direction
of University music had been given (in the interval
between Kuhnau’s death and the appointment of Bach
as his successor in the cantorate) to the pitifullest of
musicians, one Goerner,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> who was to Bach for many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">Pg 63</a></span>years a standing grievance and obstruction. The
temporary substitute was tacitly kept on by the
indulgent University magnates, and the Thomasschule
lost that connexion with the University which gave
the only promise for its revival. Moreover, Goerner,
who was also organist at S. Nicholas’&mdash;afterwards, in
1730, at S. Thomas’s, under Bach’s own authority,
which he disregarded&mdash;had a Collegium Musicum of
his own, for which he arrogated a rank superior to
the Thomasschule, the latter, in fact, being (as he
explained) merely preparatory to his. It seemed as
though the old school were destined to lose all weight
in the town. The New Church had been monopolised
by Telemann’s Musikverein; and now the
University Church was being supplied by Goerner’s
Collegium.</p>

<p>We cannot be wrong in believing that Bach was
well aware of these things; that he accepted his new
post in the high ambition of re-creating what had been
once a true home of musical art, of keeping alive and
(as we see) of infinitely exalting the honourable
tradition handed down in the learned line of his
predecessors.</p>

<p>On the 5th May, 1723, Bach appeared before the
Town Council and made the declarations of office; the
appointment was ratified by the consistory of the
church, and before the month was over he was formally
inducted.</p>

<p>From this time to his death he was settled in the
official lodgings in the left wing of the Thomasgebäude,
which, added to some 700 thalers, made up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">Pg 64</a></span>
the emoluments of his post. It is significant of the
position he was resolved to maintain that, directly
upon entering office, he distinctly subscribes himself not
only cantor of S. Thomas’s, but also, in defiance of
Goerner, Director of Music, or, as we should say,
Choragus, in the University. The double function
had belonged to his predecessor; and no one could
challenge Bach’s claim to a part of the academical
function&mdash;the duty namely of furnishing music for the
proper University services (at the quarterly Acts, the
Reformation Festival, and the three high-days of the
Church). But of late years there had been a regular
Sunday service as well, in the University Church; and
this Goerner insisted on appropriating. It was not a
mere question of fees that determined Bach’s appeal in
1725 to the King-Elector at Dresden; the entire issue
as to who should be supreme in matters musical in
Leipzig was at stake. A long correspondence as usual
brought no practical result. Goerner seems to have
retained his weekly services, and even now and then
to have encroached on Bach’s strict province of composing
special odes and the like for high University
occasions. The fact that in 1736 he is actually described
as Academical Director of Music shows that
the dispute had not even then been set at rest. It is a
common picture, this of a great man being perpetually
harassed by the pretensions of a vain fellow who is only
remembered for his self-assertion; but it reveals a
singular want of appreciation on the part of the
Leipzig authorities, that they suffered the nuisance
without a hint of its absurdity. Bach never let himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">Pg 65</a></span>
for an instant appear in the light of a rival. He only
resented the impertinence in a certain leonine fashion,
and held to his academical title.</p>

<p>This punctiliousness about titles has more in it than
shews at first sight. Bach doubtless knew his public,
and knew that, if he claimed to be a simple choir-*master,
his influence would be restricted proportionately.
But, moreover, such a description would have been
misleading, since, as Dr. Spitta observes,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> if Bach’s
music is the truest church-music, it contains none the
less the elements of independent concert-music as well.
Accordingly the titles of Capellmeister of Coethen,
which he held when he came to Leipzig, and of
Weissenfels, which was conferred upon him in the
year of his arrival, Bach bore until his death. As a
final vindication of his position, he appealed to the
king, in 1733, for a court appointment at Dresden.
The petition was accompanied by a part of the great
Mass in B minor, which was written expressly for the
royal chapel; but the honorary distinction of Composer
in Ordinary did not follow for three years.</p>

<p>Whatever honours he won from abroad, nothing to
the end of his days could spare him continual annoyance
from the municipal council. With his native
independence of spirit he could not brook the invasion
of this body into a province totally beyond their scope.
All through his life he could never get to understand
them or the reasons for their action, simply because he
knew perfectly that they were incapable of under-*
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">Pg 66</a></span>standing him. This much he knew about them, and
they gave him ample opportunity, to his cost, of
knowing it. He could not go further and make
concessions to their limited intelligence. Their presumption
irritated him, when he found his every act
hampered and restrained as though he were the most
incompetent of sciolists.</p>

<p>Bach’s grievances in relation to the council began
some years after his appointment at the Thomasschule.
At first he probably threw himself with zest into his
work, and gave no ground for fault-finding. But in
time he must have restricted himself to the bare
quantum of duty assigned to him, and given his best
energies to composition. At least the differences
begin in the spring of 1729, and the charge that he
did no work came with a peculiar force of demonstration
just when he had brought out <i>The Passion
according to Saint Matthew</i>, not to speak of three great
church-cantatas at the commemorative festival of the
Augsburg confession. The council proceeded to vote
that he was not to be trusted even in the choice of
choristers for his school. To fill nine vacancies Bach
had examined a number of competitors, and sent in a
careful report as to their qualifications. The council
accepted only five of his nominees, making up the list
by three who (as he told them) <i>nichts in Musicis
praestirten</i>, and whom he had not even named. Then
the council decided that he was so bad a teacher of
music that he must be set to secular teaching as well,
apparently as a punishment. This he managed to
escape; but he suffered a suspension of all the <i>acciden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">Pg 67</a></span>tien</i>
or extraordinary emoluments of his post. The
council resolved either to work him or to starve him
out.</p>

<p>Almost in despair, he wrote to an old friend, Erdmann
the schoolfellow who had gone up with him from
Ohrdruf to Lueneburg, now Russian agent at Danzig,
and begged for a more suitable post anywhere, if any
could be found. He gave an account of his position at
Leipzig, the reasons that drew him thither, and his
disappointment. His routine was ungrateful, his
salary reduced (it relied upon varying items, and, as he
explained, when a healthy wind blew, he could not
count on much from the funerals) and the town very
expensive&mdash;you could live in Thuringia for half as
much&mdash;above all, he was under the control of an extraordinary
council with little liking for music (<i>eine wunderliche
und der Musik wenig ergebene Obrigkeit</i>), with
which he stood perforce in continual disagreement and
ill-will. Certainly it was, as I have said, the unaccountable&mdash;"<i>wunderlich</i>"&mdash;genius
of the council
that most impressed Bach. With that consciousness
of himself which no great man is ever wholly without,
he could not understand their action. It was an
incongruity in the nature of things which would have
been comical had it not been a perpetual irritation to
him.</p>

<p>There is, however, no hint of this irritation, but
rather a haughty disdain which shows through the
verbose respectfulness of Bach’s official memorials.
Once, for instance, when he was rehearsing a Passion
music for Good Friday, the council insisted on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">Pg 68</a></span>
submitting it to their inspection. He replied that he
had gone to work precisely as on former occasions,
the text in fact had been already produced more than
once. However, he was not concerned to perform the
thing: it would only give him trouble and no profit.
He would report to his ecclesiastical superior that the
council forbade its performance. In this way he
managed to shift the dispute on to the shoulders of
the consistory, which had a standing quarrel with
the council as to their respective powers over the
school. The present question belonged clearly to the
church body; and it is evidently with grim satisfaction
that Bach seizes on the technical mistake.
Let it be noticed, too, how he refuses to give any
explanation, refuses even to complain of his disappointment.
He says, in so many words, that he is dealing
with mere business people, and will use merely business
arguments.</p>

<p>Again, in 1730, when they sent one of their number
to admonish him gravely of the submission which was
due to them, Bach was preparing&mdash;perhaps had already
sent in&mdash;an elaborate and carefully arranged report
on the wide-reaching reform and extension which he demanded
for the choir and orchestra under his direction.
There is an irony in the way the man, who is to be
frightened into docility by a retrenchment of his salary
and influence, occupies himself meantime in devising
and proving the necessity of a large scheme which
should extend the scope of his authority and indirectly
augment his income. The reform, of course, never came,
and the memoir is only interesting as the reflection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">Pg 69</a></span>
the independent nature of the writer, and as evidence
of the dimensions to which instrumental music had
grown under his hands. It should, however, be mentioned
that in the ten previous years the council had
not been unmindful of the needs of the two chief
churches, and had sanctioned an unusual outlay in the
repair of the organs and in the purchase of stringed
instruments and music-books for the performers.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to turn from these disputes and
anxiety to the glimpse&mdash;unfortunately almost a solitary
glimpse&mdash;of the home life which saved Bach from
ever really despairing, and which cheered him in a
thankful contentment, so that no disappointment from
without was able to dwarf his energy for work, or to
cool the genial spirit which ever attended his composing.
At the end of the letter to Erdmann, from
which I have already quoted, he says: <i>I must now
acquaint you with somewhat of my domestic estate. For
the second time I am married, my first lamented wife
having deceased at Coethen. Of her I have living three
sons and a daughter, whom your Excellence will kindly
remember to have seen at Weimar; of the second marriage
there are living a son and two daughters. My
eldest son is a student of law, the next two are at school
in the first and second class, and my eldest daughter
remains unmarried. The children of my second marriage
are still little, the eldest a boy of six years. Altogether,
however, they are born musicians, and I can assure you
that even now I can arrange a concert with my family</i>
vocaliter <i>and</i> instrumentaliter, <i>whereas my wife that</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">Pg 70</a></span>
<i>now is sings a pretty</i> soprano, <i>and my eldest daughter
plays not amiss</i>.</p>

<p>From a variety of scattered facts we may form some
idea of the activity of this musical house. Indeed,
just at this time the home was reaching its happiest
period. The two eldest boys, the worthiest inheritors
of the family genius, were still with their father; and
there is hardly a doubt that it was to play with them
that Sebastian wrote his two concertos for three
pianos. Who formed the orchestra we can only conjecture,
but it is certain that the string of pupils who
had formed part of his household since he began
married life at Muehlhausen, and who continued in
increasing numbers until his death, were in different
degrees capable of giving their help; and the gaps
may have been filled by promising scholars of the
Thomasschule, or, indeed, by the&mdash;chiefly under-*graduate&mdash;members
of the Musical Society of which
Bach undertook the management in 1729. We know,
from the inventory taken after his death, that he possessed
latterly five <i>clavecins</i> (the word must be used
inaccurately, and taken to include clavichords) and ten
stringed instruments, not counting his three lutes; so
that in the house itself there was material for the
nucleus of an orchestra, though violinists would
probably, and players on wind instruments necessarily,
bring their own instruments with them. In all this
domestic music his wife took her share, both as player
on the clavichord, in which she was his apt pupil, and
especially as a singer. It is likely that some church
cantatas were written for her and for the eldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">Pg 71</a></span>
daughter Katharina (who sang <i>alto</i>) as may be inferred
from the prevalence in such of one <i>solo</i> voice, and by
other points (for instance, the shortness of one) which
render them unfit for performance in church.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Nor
need we doubt that a similar use dictated Bach’s great
collection of 240 chorales, of which unhappily only
fragments remain. For it is almost needless to observe
that the old German temper in its best form combined
religion inextricably with all the common acts of life.
We know how the festive gatherings of the Bachs, however
jovial their purpose, always began with a chorale;
and Sebastian himself, seeking for a definition of
music, can find nothing more comprehensive to say
than that <i>Its final cause is none other than this, that it
minister solely to the honour of God and refreshment of
the spirit; whereof, if one take not heed, it is no proper
music, but devilish din and discord</i>.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>The preparation for these perpetual concerts must
have furnished incessant occupation to the household.
Printed music was very rare and costly, and, as a
matter of course, the parts had regularly to be copied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">Pg 72</a></span>out. A great deal exists in the delicate hand of Anna
Magdalena Bach, who also transcribed many scores for
her husband’s private use. No one was idle, and a
certain amount even of music-engraving was done in
this busy house. Bach himself, we are told, often
laboured far into the night. The day was not long
enough for all he found to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">Pg 73</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>Bach’s appeal to Erdmann in the winter of 1730, to
try and find him a more congenial post than he had at
Leipzig, was without result. In fact, little as he suspected
it, events had already begun to take a favourable
turn for him. The year before, the organist of
the New Church had left, and Bach had followed him
as director of the Musical Society, which had hitherto
furnished the choir at that church, instead of the boys
of the Thomasschule. It was a good thing for Bach in
every way to break down a rivalry of this sort. But a
greater gain had come to him the very month before
he wrote to Erdmann. For the new rector of the
school, Gesner, proved himself consistently the firm
friend of the ill-used cantor.</p>

<p>Gesner appears to have been much more than his
books shew him&mdash;one of the revivers of classical learning
in Germany. He was also a teacher by instinct,
one who by infinite tact and patience could restore harmony
to a school that had been dissolving for a generation,
and form so direct an understanding between
master and pupil that the friend was seen through the
severe disciplinarian, and the fervent scholar through
the mists and morasses of an antiquated pedagogy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">Pg 74</a></span>
He diffused a new spirit into the school; to Bach he
gave his generous sympathy, and an earnest of hopefulness.
How he appreciated him as a musician has
already been noticed in another connexion; as head of
the school he saved him from the petty annoyances
to which he had hitherto been subjected. Bach had
now his just share of the fees which made the largest
item in his income and which were now the more
necessary as his family was growing up. Moreover,
thrifty as he was, his different posts must have involved
expensive journeys to Coethen and Weissenfels;
and he was fond of making short visits to Dresden to
hear the opera, at that time under the leading of his
friend Hasse, <i>Il Sassone</i>, as he is known by the Italians,
among whom he lived for many years, and whose
music in turn he naturalised in Germany. <i>Friedemann,
let us go again and hear the pretty Dresden
songs</i>, Bach would say to his boy; and the two went
together. The phrase used is, by the way, characteristic
of Bach. He enjoyed the opera, but could
not call it by any more dignified name than <i>songs</i>
(<i>liederchen</i>). Accordingly he never adopted this form
of composition; his genius is essentially undramatic.
But he studied the operatic style with eager energy,
and absorbed it so thoroughly that the arias, duets,
&amp;c., which occur in his cantatas, are the worthiest representatives
of the opera that Germany produced
before Gluck, whom indeed he anticipated in his treatment
of the recitative. They have the gaiety and
grace of the Italian manner, and the inspiration of
German thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">Pg 75</a></span></p>

<p>The secular post which Bach also held at Leipzig gave
a wide opening for compositions specially in this style.
The purpose of musical clubs, said his predecessor
Kuhnau, in his <i>Musicalischer Quack-Salber</i>, written in
1700, is for musicians <i>ever to exercise themselves farther
in their noble calling, and withal from the pleasant
harmony to establish among themselves so like a sweet-sounding
agreement of tempers, as oftentimes is mainly
lacking in their conversation</i>. We may think of Bach
as realising this description, as he presided over the
<i>amateur</i> gatherings held on winter-nights in a coffee-*house
in the Katharinenstrasse, or in summer of an
afternoon in a garden outside the town in the Windmühlengasse.
These informal concerts lasted two
hours, and took place weekly, or twice a week during
the great popular festivals of Leipzig, the quarterly fairs.</p>

<p>We have no express evidence of what purely instrumental
compositions Bach wrote for the society.
No doubt he revived the chamber-music he had composed
at Coethen; and the bulk of his concertos dating
from Leipzig would probably be performed at its
meetings. The works which are known to have been
produced there are chiefly a string of secular cantatas&mdash;perhaps
we should rather say <i>serenatas</i>, though the
actual title is specifically <i>Dramma per Musica</i>. To
these we may add the other compositions which are
described simply as for the university students in
general, with whom from the first he was in constant
request at times of rejoicing, birthdays of favourite
teachers, their election as professors, and a multitude
of festive occasions prompted by the accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">Pg 76</a></span>
loyalty of undergraduates. These pieces are commonly
distinguished as dramatic chamber-music; but it must
be borne in mind that, although hardly ever acted in
costume, they were often presented, not in a room, but
with the natural scenery, for instance, of a garden.
Bach rarely spent his best work on such ephemeral displays&mdash;they
mostly had to be got ready in a few days&mdash;and
whenever he found afterwards that he had included
in them anything in his judgment worth preserving,
he incorporated it in a church cantata or some
more lasting composition. In this way nearly the
whole of a <i>drama</i>, written for the Queen’s birthday in
1733, came subsequently to form part of the Christmas
oratorio. But we must guard against the inference
that Bach was careless of the relation between music
and words. On the contrary, we have the distinct
statement of a friend, himself a teacher of rhetoric at
Leipzig, that Bach’s <i>mastery over the qualities and the
excellencies which music has in common with rhetoric is
such as not only to add unfailing pleasure to his discourses
upon the likeness and correspondency between
them, but also to move our admiration at the skilful
use of his principles in his works</i>. So wrote Magister
Birnbaum in 1739; and the importance which Agricola,
who was Bach’s pupil for three years, attaches to the
study of rhetoric by musicians, was probably caught
from his teacher. The truth is that Bach was before
all things a sacred composer, and when he adopts in a
sacred work that which had once belonged to something
secular, it is not from haste, indifference, or a
want of fertility, but purely because the piece would find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">Pg 77</a></span>
its proper home in a sacred setting. It does not surprise
us, therefore, to find that he habitually brought up old
compositions, with new words, for the festivities for
which he was called upon to provide, and that many
of them have entirely perished, their existence being
only known from the circulated programme.</p>

<p>The following seven cantatas are all that remain:&mdash;1.
In honour of Dr. Mueller,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> 3rd August, 1725. 2.
On the Promotion of Professor G. Kortte,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> 11th
December, 1726. 3. The Contest of Ph&oelig;us and
Pan,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> 1731. 4. Hercules at the Boundary,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> 5th September,
1733. 5. At the Queen’s Birthday, 8th
December, 1733. 6. At a Royal Visit to Leipzig,
5th October, 1734. 7. At the King’s Birthday,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> 7th
October, 1734.</p>

<p>Of these the third alone can claim more than a
limited appreciation; and this has a novel interest outside
the music, in certain satirical allusions, under the
character of Midas, to one Scheibe, a poor musician,
whom Bach had rejected as candidate for an organistship,
and who never lost an opportunity of showing
his ill-will against the too rhadamanthyne judge.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>This satire connects the student-cantatas with two
works of a professed humourous character. One is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">Pg 78</a></span>the so-called <i>Coffee-cantata</i>, which turns upon the
comparatively modern rage for coffee, supplanting all
human joys and interests. Comic pieces of this sort
were not unknown in Bach’s time. His cousin Nikolaus
had written one called the <i>Tapster of Jena</i>, and in
a kindred vein Bach inserted a most sympathetic ditty
upon his tobacco-pipe in one of the books he wrote
for his wife.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> But the genial side of Bach’s temper is
best reflected in his <i>Cantate en Burlesque</i>, known as
the <i>Peasant’s Cantata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> It was composed in 1742 for
a feast-day in a village near Leipzig to celebrate the
coming of a new landlord, and is full of a frolicsome
gaiety that looks like the freshness of a young man’s
work; only we know, for instance, from the <i>Winter’s
Tale</i>, that such may often shew the mellowed spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">Pg 79</a></span>older years. The <i>libretto</i> is made up of <i>badinage</i>,
more or less clumsy, between the countrymen, who
like their own old fashion of doing honour to their
lord, and the upstarts who try to introduce a new-*fangled
courtly style. The genuine swains get the
better of it, and have a great deal to say for themselves
in a rough way, starting in the true Saxon
brogue, and breaking out into popular songs which
were in every one’s mouth at the time. The music,
which is never vulgar, is certainly the lightest that
Bach wrote; but the <i>volkslieder</i> do not stand alone in
his works. Two such songs he has wrought with
inimitable art and charm into the Quodlibet which
closes his thirty variations in G.</p>

<p>The list of Bach’s secular cantatas is completed by
some wedding-music,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> and by the pieces he wrote for
state occasions. Three of the latter, all birthday cantatas,
remain.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> One was composed in 1716 for the
Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, when the event was celebrated
by a great hunt;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> the second is a serenade for
the Prince of Coethen, perhaps in 1717;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">Pg 80</a></span>third, for his second consort, in 1726.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Of far greater
importance must have been the <i>Dirges</i> which Bach
composed for mourning solemnities, and which are indeed
only distinguished from the rest of his church
music by the personal reference. The music he wrote
in 1729 on the death of his patron is lost; but it is
supposed to have been to a great extent built upon
the <i>S. Matthew Passion</i>. That which he composed,
however, two years earlier, for the Queen of Poland
remains to us, and apparently was subsequently re-*erected
into the (now lost) <i>Passion according to S.
Mark</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> On these occasions the appointed mourning
did not begin for some months, and Bach had therefore
time to devote thought to them such as he was not
able to give in the hurried seasons of rejoicing. In
itself, the more weighty occasion stirred him to deeper
reflexion, and the <i>Dirge for Queen Christine Eberhardine</i>
is of more value than all his secular cantatas put together.
It shows Bach to us in his native sphere,
that of a church composer, and leads naturally to the
consideration of his work as such in its wider manifestations.</p>

<p>His church cantatas are among the earliest and the
most mature of Bach’s productions; but the bulk of
them were written while he was cantor at Leipzig.
Barely thirty can be assigned to an earlier period,
while from 1723 onwards he set himself to compose
a complete cycle for five church years&mdash;near 300
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">Pg 81</a></span>cantatas&mdash;in which of course he inserted his younger
works, though never without a scrupulous revision.
Of this marvellous series about two hundred remain.
Musicians owe an incalculable debt to Dr. Spitta for
the exhaustive scrutiny to which he has subjected
every individual number; and although his results,
which will be found tabulated at the end of this
volume, are in a certain degree tentative, yet their
general accuracy can hardly fail to be accepted. In
comparatively few cases does the doubt as the chronological
place of a cantata extend over more than four
years; and the student is therefore for the first time
enabled to place each one with security in its proper
setting in the total list of Bach’s works.</p>

<p>But it is not the number, but the wonderful variety,
individual character, and consummate workmanship,
of the church cantatas, that make them an absolutely
unique phænomenon in music. It is hardly necessary
to say that they have nothing in common with the
Italian <i>cantata</i>, which was a mere operatic <i>scena</i> for
<i>solo</i> voices.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> The church cantata may be roughly
called a short oratorio. Its component parts are one
or more choruses and chorales with recitatives and
<i>solo</i> airs; but the form is as elastic as that of the
modern <i>sonata</i>, and one at least of the elements may
often be absent. In Bach’s hands the type was enlarged
in more than one direction, especially under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">Pg 82</a></span>the influence of the instrumental music of Italy. His
first preserved cantata, dating perhaps from 1704,
shows how he was abandoning the purely polyphonic
treatment, which the Germans had adopted but never
been at ease with, and creating for himself his own
manipulation of voices in an instrumental manner.
When at Weimar he pursued his studies through the
entire range of Italian chamber-music accessible to
him, the effect was not to make him in any sense
imitate them. His chamber-music is almost wholly of
later date. What he did was to apply the forms of
the <i>sonata</i> and <i>concerto</i> to the clavichord, the organ,
and above all to the church cantata. In this way he
brought to perfection his art of writing <i>solo-arias</i>, of
which the earlier examples are so complete and mature
as to leave no room for future improvement. Here
accordingly he made little change in the course of his
later composing; and the same holds good for his
treatment of the recitative, <i>arioso</i>, and simple chorale.
The variety he threw into the structure of the cantata
is infinite. Sometimes a whole cantata takes the shape
of a <i>concerto</i>, or of an orchestral <i>partie</i>; sometimes its
second division is opened by a regular chamber-sonata.
An overture in French style is combined with a
freely-imagined chorus, even with a chorale. Dance-measures,
the <i>passacaglia</i>, even the jig, are not excluded;
and a chorale has its counterpoint in a
<i>siciliano</i>. Everywhere instrumental forms are applied,
in a way hitherto unsuspected, to the development
of church-music. Now a chorale is played by the
orchestra in the midst of a recitative, as though to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">Pg 83</a></span>
set a bound to its unmeasured phrases: now the recitative
appears as a personal application of the thought
between the lines of a chorale. But the influences of
the master’s boyhood are not forgotten: except in the
<i>arias</i>, the organ is the main basis of his cantata-style;
and Pachelbel, Boehm, Buxtehude, have still their
reminiscence, in a more glorious apparel. The old
forms are broadened, and combined, with inconceivable
fancy, with one another and with the new forms which
Bach devised for himself.</p>

<p>It is in the choruses, however, that the Leipzig
cantatas rise above the works of Bach’s earlier time.
The great choruses which he wrote at Weimar, for
instance, the splendid one that opens <i>Ich hatte viel
Bekümmerniss</i>, are indeed models of his instrumental
treatment. The difference between his early and later
writing is rather the uniform massiveness and magnificence
of the latter&mdash;the more complete absorption
in them of the organ-style. Though generally formed
on a figured subject, they are wrought with far
greater freedom and force. The choruses, based upon
the melody of a chorale, are unmatched in depth and
grandeur, and it was to these, the rich embodiment
of his strenuous religious sense, that Bach turned with
peculiar affection in his later years; a long series
of cantatas in which they take the chief place were
written by him from 1735 onwards.</p>

<p>Yet, it must be confessed that the church cantatas
suffer exceedingly from the poverty of the texts to
which they are written. Unless Bach draws directly
from the Bible or from the old chorale-hymns&mdash;for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">Pg 84</a></span>
chorales have a mine of poetry within their rough
mass&mdash;there are few places in which one is not repelled
by the tastelessness of the rhymes he had to use.
Bach himself seems at one time to have been conscious
of their inadequacy and to have returned to the
nervous religious poetry of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. One cannot but suspect that the finer
judgment of Gesner&mdash;they all bear traces of having
been composed during his stay at Leipzig&mdash;had something
to do with the improved choice of subject. But
commonly the texts are derived from three contemporary
poetasters, Franck and Neumeister of Weimar
and Picander of Leipzig. The last was a neighbour
of Bach’s and a docile follower. In fact we cannot,
where he was concerned, exculpate Bach from a certain
responsibility for the texts. Certainly Picander wrote
as he was bid, and would alter as Bach told him. But
probably the musician felt that he could do no better
than employ so convenient a hack, and it would be
going beyond all we know of his life to assume that the
artistic sensibility which swayed him in matters musical
extended also into the domain of letters. He was
content if the meaning of the words agreed with the
music.</p>

<p>It remains to add that all the church cantatas are
written for orchestra, but for an orchestra of very
varying compass, ranging from the simple bass, which
accompanies the recitative, to dimensions scarcely
inferior to those of modern times; only Bach seldom
employed the whole available body at once. He liked
to have a reserve, to prevent the music of one Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">Pg 85</a></span>
being exactly like its neighbour; and he was specially
fond of keeping an instrument to come out prominently
as the <i>obbligato</i> accompaniment of an <i>aria</i>.</p>

<p>Among the cantatas there stands a composition of a
partly different character. This is the <i>Ascension Oratorio</i>,
which connects itself by its title with the two
more important works of the same sort which Bach has
left, namely, the <i>Easter</i> and <i>Christmas Oratorios</i>, written
respectively in 1734 and 1736. The second has the
nearest resemblance of the three to what we know as
oratorios elsewhere: the last, by far the greatest, is
divided into six parts, for performance on Christmas
and the two days following, New Year’s Day, the first
Sunday in the year, and the Epiphany. It has, however,
a unity of feeling running through it, which stamps it as
a single work. We have already noticed and explained
the presence here of much that had previously formed
part of secular cantatas; but it may be added that there
is the less incongruity in the case when we consider
how largely the rejoicing of Christmastide was mixed
up with social festivities. That Bach, however, was
careful lest the deeper meaning of the incarnation
should be forgotten, is shown by the employment of
the melody of a well-known Passion chorale&mdash;his
favourite <i>O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden</i>&mdash;which
occurs twice, the second time with an exuberance of
instrumental accompaniment to close the work. The
Oratorio has by this time become so familiar in England
that it is perhaps unnecessary to describe its structure.
Nothing of Bach surpasses it in the warm life of its
choruses or the delicate charm of its airs&mdash;the purity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">Pg 86</a></span>
of one alto song, <i>Bereite dich, Zion</i>, or the idyllic
beauty of another, <i>Schlafe, mein Liebster</i>, than which
no lovelier lullaby has ever been written.</p>

<p>Before noticing the mysteries which Bach consecrated
to the history of the Passion&mdash;works by the side of
which the Christmas Oratorio takes a worthy place,
rather by virtue of its great compass and masterly
performance, than by any close affinity of scheme&mdash;we
may complete the summary of his German works by a
brief mention of the <i>Motets</i>.</p>

<p>The motet may be described as a sacred madrigal: in
other words, it is written in several parts, commonly
four, five, six, or eight; it does not require an instrumental
accompaniment; and it is set to a text from
the Bible, or a verse from a church hymn. It was a
style of composition entirely polyphonic, which had
gradually declined in popularity as instrumental music
and especially solo singing came into vogue. And it is
one of Bach’s great services to church-music to have
revived it, so that in the present day the weekly motet-singing
in his own Church at Leipzig remains one
of the most popular institutions of the town. Contrary,
however, to the custom now, Bach seems to have had
the motets accompanied, apparently on the organ; and
this fact indicates their principal distinction from the
older style. They are in fact based upon an organ
treatment, and have precise parallels in several chorale-movements
in the church cantatas. Few, however,
have survived the carelessness of Bach’s successors at
the Thomasschule, though their melodious figuration
and religious sublimity might, one would have thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">Pg 87</a></span>
have secured their unintermitted performance there.
When Mozart came to Leipzig in 1789, and heard one
of them (No. 5) he exclaimed, <i>Here is a new thing from
which I may learn</i>, and, finding that the piece existed
only in parts, he ranged them round the room until
he had mastered their structure. The following are all
that remain, not included in the body of church
cantatas:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Lobet den Herrn</i><a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> for four voices;</p>

<p>2. <i>Nun danket alle Gott</i> for five;</p>

<p>3. <i>Jesu, meine Freude</i>, also for five;</p>

<p>4. <i>Der Geist hilft unsrer Schwachheit auf</i>;</p>

<p>5. <i>Singet den Herrn ein neues Lied</i>;</p>

<p>6. <i>Fürchte dich nicht</i>;</p>

<p>7. <i>Komm, Jesu, komm</i>; the last four for a double
chorus of eight voices.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>Bach is stated to have written a Passion music in five
different shapes. Two of these are the familiar <i>Passions
according to S. Matthew</i> and <i>S. John</i>, which are the
truest reflexion of the master’s genius in his ripest
years. The other three were long supposed to have
been lost, unless a <i>S. Luke Passion</i>, which exists in
Bach’s autograph, might possibly be claimed as his
work. Lately, however, the acute study of Dr. Rust
has discovered part of a <i>S. Mark Passion</i> to lie hid
under the guise of the <i>Dirge for the Queen of Poland</i>,
Bach having sought in this way to give permanence to a
work of which the original motive was merely fugitive;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
and Professor Spitta has made it probable that Bach
also wrote the music to a Passion following the text
of no single evangelist, which was produced at the
Thomaskirche in 1725.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> He further offers an elaborate
and conclusive defence of the genuineness of the
<i>S. Luke Passion</i>, which he places without hesitation
in the early years of Bach’s residence at Weimar.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">Pg 89</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>S. John Passion</i> comes second in the series, and
was brought out in 1724. Of the presumptive work
of 1725, above-mentioned, a solitary chorus exists in
record. The <i>Passion according to S. Matthew</i> follows
in 1729; and last of all, in 1731, that <i>according to
S. Mark</i>. The printed text of this, which we still
possess, was adapted by Picander to the <i>Dirge</i> of
1727; but it had necessarily to be greatly augmented
for the occasion, and of this supplemental
music nothing remains to us.</p>

<p>The dramatic presentment of the passion of Jesus
Christ is one of the oldest traditions of the German
people. A continuous line unites the Passion Play of
Ober-Ammergau with the Mystery of the medieval
church. In this respect the reformation made no
change in the popular religious custom. We may find
it at Zittau, in 1571, when a stage was erected in the
church, and the drama acted by the schoolmasters
and choir; or we may trace it in every part of Silesia,
Upper Saxony, and Thuringia, down to the close of
the seventeenth century. Side by side this popular
representation stood the church usage of distributing
the parts of the passion-narrative between the officiating
priest and the choir, a usage which plainly took its
origin in a desire to give life to the Latin words. The
necessity of it was removed when the Gospel came to
be recited in the vernacular tongue, but the habit had
struck too deep roots in the heart of the people to be
interfered with. The Catholic wont survived, with so
much else in the Lutheran churches of Middle Germany;
and the musical Passion remained, at Leipzig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">Pg 90</a></span>
at least, a part of the regular service until the second
half of the eighteenth century. German Passions at
once sprang up, and won an ever-increasing popularity,
since it was now attempted to exalt their religious
impression by an artistic treatment of the subject as a
whole. At first the music hardly departed from the
strict medieval recitation; then it was varied by the
introduction of hymns; the form of the motet was
added, and found so attractive that it was applied
universally and nothing was left for a <i>solo</i> voice.
The recited Gospel&mdash;once the basis of the whole&mdash;seemed
to be falling into disuse, when it was suddenly
revived in the shape of the new Italian discovery, the
<i>recitative</i>, especially in that most expressive variety,
the <i>arioso</i>. Instrumental accompaniment became the
rule; the story was interrupted by short symphonies;
above all, the <i>aria</i> was introduced, to give stress to
the spiritual feeling of the text, as a sort of emotional
commentary. Finally, the Italian importation was
naturalised, as it were, by the insertion of chorales,
at first sung by the congregation, and increasing in
number to twenty, thirty, or even more.</p>

<p>Hitherto the foreign element had been drawn from
the concerted music of the Italian churches. A more
potent influence entered Germany during Bach’s
youth, that namely which proceeded from the Italian
theatre&mdash;opera or oratorio, it mattered little; for in
each, though the form was different, the spirit was the
same.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> The first result in Germany has an analogy in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">Pg 91</a></span>the contemporary stage of the history of the church
cantata. The place of the chorale or direct biblical
recitative was taken by poems written for the occasion;
it was sought to realise a religious impression, not by
these plain and popular means, but by the poetic
unity of the composition. A reaction, however, soon
took place in favour of the popular form; and the
Passion text of Brockes (1712), which combined
chorales and the words of the Gospel, slightly altered,
it is true, with the general structure of an oratorio,
immediately established itself as a model, and was set
to music, within six years of its publication, by musicians
of the eminence of Keiser, Telemann, Handel,
and Mattheson. It forms also the basis of Bach’s
<i>S. John Passion</i>; but here the biblical narrative is
followed with entire fidelity,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> and the master has proceeded
with such independent judgment that his work
stands quite remote from the strange medley of sacred
and secular, old and new, with which his immediate
predecessors had to be contented. The music they
wrote to it was indeed of great individual beauty, but in
their hands it never gained the symmetry of an organic
whole. It is Bach’s peculiar glory to have succeeded
in this endeavour where everyone else had failed. He
adopted not the forms of the Italian oratorio, but he
absorbed its spirit. He blended it in a manner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">Pg 92</a></span>which no previous composer had ever suspected the
possibility, with the profound religiousness of the
national chorale. Above all, he created a recitative
of his own, stripped of all that was theatrical and
entirely appropriate to the setting forth of the divine
narrative. In his Passion music he brings to absolute
completeness the form for which his conception of the
church cantata had been through long years the preparation.
But musical power alone could not have
achieved what Bach achieved. It was his perfect
sympathy with the religious sense and emotional needs
of the German people, his reverent acceptance of all
that was noble in the musical tradition of his race,
that enabled him to mould the ideal fulfilment of that
which had been imperfectly foreshadowed in the presentments
of the passion, whether as an act of divine
service, a folk-play, or an oratorio.</p>

<p>The <i>Passions according to S. John</i> and <i>S. Matthew</i> lie
before us as the noblest monuments of Bach’s spirit.
Often as they have been compared, to the inevitable
disadvantage of the former work, it needs little study
of them to shew that any comparison must be strained
and unnatural. Each is in truth incomparable, whether
in relation to the other, or to the rest of sacred music.
The <i>S. John Passion</i> is the perfection of church-music;
the <i>S. Matthew</i> reaches the goal of all sacred art,
while its colossal dimensions take it almost, happily
not quite, out of the range of church performance.
The <i>S. John Passion</i> stands closer to the oratorio, as
we may learn from the way in which nearly every
choral sentence, that is to say, whatever is spoken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">Pg 93</a></span>
the disciples, the Jewish crowd, or the soldiers, is
wrought into a regular chorus, or at least several
times repeated. This arrangement certainly impairs
the proportion of the different parts, since it appears
to lay a greater emphasis upon the voice of the many
than upon the single utterance of Christ or another.
There is, however, always a musical fitness in these
elaborations, and nothing can be more artistic than
the way in which, for example, the sentence, <i>We have
a law, and by our law he ought to die</i>, is rehearsed as
the subject of a fugue, the most formal and (so to say)
legal phrase that music admits, and also the most
expressive of the dispersed yet unanimous speech of a
multitude. It is part of the idea of Passion music to
break the continuity of the narrative in the Gospel by
chorales and by meditations, in the form of <i>arias</i> or of
developed recitative (called <i>arioso</i>), dwelling upon the
weighty moments of the story, after the fashion of the
chorus in Greek tragedy; and Bach has taken advantage
of the custom to insert in the <i>S. John Passion</i>
some of his most melodious and most profoundly
impressive creations. But, what is highly significant
of the spirit in which he planned his work, he never
allows these to interrupt the real unity of the narrative,
almost invariably prolonging the vocal cadence of the
foregoing recitative by leaving it on the dominant
harmony. “The course of the action and the reflections
upon it seem thus to be linked in unbroken
sequence, as if the one sprang irresistibly to the other.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">Pg 94</a></span></p>
<p>The entire work is begun and ended by great choruses.
The opening one was written and prefixed later, the
original chorus having been relegated to the close of
the first part of the <i>S. Matthew Passion</i>;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> that at the
end has also a similar inspiration to the concluding
chorus of the latter work, but its preservation in its
present form as well is a matter for which we cannot
be too grateful, whether we regard most the exquisite
pathos of its melody or the perfect flow of the several
instruments, which, in their separate progressions, give
a personal, almost an individual, sentiment to the
composition. This sentiment lies at the root of the
<i>Passion according to S. John</i>, and makes a peculiar
contrast to the universality which is the note of that
according to <i>S. Matthew</i>. As though to merge this
mood in a broader sympathy with his fellow-believers,
Bach has protracted the end so as to close the work
by a chorale, the distinctive symbol of congregational
brotherhood.</p>

<p>If this be the motive of the unusual termination of
the earlier Passion, Bach has no need to explain his
intention in the <i>Passion according to S. Matthew</i>. In
the first bars of the opening chorus the long majestic
tread of the basses is heard clearly to introduce us to
the thought of a drama of which the whole world is
the spiritual scene, all mankind, in their Representative,
the actors. The never-ending wail of the violins
preludes to a tragedy which sums up all human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">Pg 95</a></span>suffering. The cry has slowly risen to its height when
the daughters of Zion are shown to us, assembled to
mourn, in the same piercing measures, the Bridegroom
as he passes on bearing his cross. A chorus of
believers, with wondering question, first interrupts
their lament, finally takes up their burthen and unites
in the common sorrow. Meantime the listening ear
detects a third choir, of a single voice, singing as from
afar, and again strangely breaking off, the chorale,
<i>O Lamb of God</i>. The art of the work is stupendous;
but more wonderful still is the truthfulness with which
it figures forth the immensity of the drama to which it
is the prologue.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was far remote from Bach’s mind to
present the Passion in the guise of a drama; it would
have been altogether foreign to the essence of his
genius. The Passion he will shew to us as a picture,
or rather as a series of pictures. He takes the text of
S. Matthew without gloss or change; choruses he
leaves in the terse briefness of natural utterance,
repeating little or not at all. He seeks to give just
expression to the words by a thoughtful distribution of
the speeches between two complete choirs, each with
its own organ and orchestra. Above all he separates
the words of Jesus from the rest of the recited
narrative by a different accompaniment, that of a
string quartet, within which setting he places them,
with the purity of a crystal, as within an aureole.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">Pg 96</a></span>certain moments of supreme dignity, the simple recitative
rises into the measured melody of the <i>arioso</i>,
the words, however, remaining without change. In
this way the solemn act of the last supper is carried to
a sublime height, and inspired with a supernal tenderness,
wherein music reaches its noblest and most
divine ideal. Once only does the glory fade from
around Christ’s words, and that is at the last cry, <i>Eli,
Eli, lama asabthani</i>. Here it is the organ&mdash;the
accompaniment of the human recitative&mdash;which alone
sustains the harmony. It is the finest thought in all
Bach’s writing.</p>

<p>The additions to the text of the Gospel are of two
sorts. First there are the chorales, which appear in
great frequency owing to the numerous repetitions of
a few melodies. One, the special Passion chorale,
<i>O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden</i>, recurs five times, with
different words, and the harmonies each time newly
constructed. The intention is evidently to fix the
thought upon the prevailing tone of the subject, in the
same fashion, diversely applied, as that of the modern
<i>Leitmotiv</i>. Beside these chorales stand Picander’s
verses which are set in the form, not only of <i>arias</i> or
<i>ariosos</i>, but also of recitative; and these, to throw the
biblical recitative into greater relief, have, for the
most part, an accompaniment of wind instruments:
sometimes the single voice is blended, as in converse,
with the voices of the choir. Usually in the Passion
music the company of the faithful came simply as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">Pg 97</a></span>prologue and epilogue; here, on the contrary, it
attends throughout, and from one side of the church
answers to the voice of the Daughter of Zion on the
other. Once and again the multitudinous cry breaks
in upon the pathos of her song; and it seems as if no
place were void of the all-pervading agony. At the
end both choirs join together in a hymn of tender
watching addressed to the Saviour as he lies sleeping
in the tomb.</p>

<p>We should certainly fail to appreciate Bach’s place
as a writer for the church, if we left out of regard his
<i>Masses</i>. That a composer so peculiarly representative
of Protestantism should have written such works will
only surprise those who are unfamiliar with the usage
of Lutheran worship. The conservatism of Leipzig, in
particular, retained many Catholic customs which the
Protestant churches as a rule had discarded, for instance,
the surplices of minister and choir, and the
ringing of a bell during the eucharistal office. Latin
motets, hymns, and responses, were sung on high
festivals; and the use of the Latin <i>Magnificat</i> furnished
Bach with a theme for perhaps the splendidest of his
shorter church compositions.</p>

<p>The original performance of the <i>Magnificat</i> throws
an interesting light on the manner in which the old
tradition of the Latin singing was fused with an
entirely popular service. The famous work, notable
also as the first masterpiece which Bach produced at
Leipzig, was not performed on the Christmas of 1723,
as we now hear it, as a continuous whole. It was
broken up by a string of Christmas songs, which, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">Pg 98</a></span>
may rather say, served as a curiously wrought setting
to enhance the beauty of the gem it enclosed. At
every pause the thanksgiving of the virgin-mother was
interrupted by verses of a well-loved German hymn,
<i>Vom Himmel hoch</i>, by the <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>, and by
little songs, part in Latin, part German, of the most
homely simplicity. Most likely the church too kept
the old German fashion, with its cradle and lullaby
and touching chorus of angels. Strangely out of place
must the superb canticle have sounded, but for that
reverent spirit which breathes through it and makes it
a fulfilment of Protestant feeling, and a contrast only
by completion.</p>

<p>Besides these occasional performances, the first
three divisions of a complete Mass&mdash;the <i>Kyrie</i>, <i>Gloria</i>,
and <i>Credo</i>&mdash;formed a regular part of the service on
Sundays and feast-days; the <i>Sanctus</i> distinguished the
three high festivals of the Lutheran kalendar: the
only element of the Mass which is not known to have
been sung was the <i>Agnus Dei</i>, and even of this we have
evidence that it was performed in the University
Church (from a Mass of Haydn) later on in the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Accordingly there is nothing to hinder the supposition
that Bach employed his <i>Masses</i> for production in
the Leipzig churches. Concerning two of the five he
wrote<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> this is highly probable; and a similar influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">Pg 99</a></span>is suggested by the transcripts of several Italian
Masses, drawn from such different sources as Palestrina
and Lotti, which exist in Bach’s autograph and
in that of his wife and son. At the least the latter
bear witness to the hold which this form of church-*music
had taken upon his mind. But it was not until
he had traversed the whole field of Protestant music
that he allowed himself to rise to the conception of a
work that should embrace the universal faith of
Christendom, whose voice should be persuasive to the
hopes and beliefs of Catholic and Protestant alike, the
sonorous majesty of the one growing intense in the
human earnestness of the other. To this Mass in B
minor<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> Bach put all his strength, consecrated every
resource of inspiration and art, every possibility of
voice and instrument. While Catholic writers have
treated the Mass music as the gorgeous accompaniment
of a mighty pomp, in which the outward,
dramatic, impressiveness stands in the foreground,
Bach passes back to the verities of which the sacred
office is the symbol. Thus his <i>Kyrie</i> is not the mere
opening of a stately pageant. From four bars of
majestic chorus, the orchestra go on at once to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">Pg 100</a></span>announce a theme unsurpassed in the entire range of
Bach’s music; each of the five voices of the choir take
it up in turn and weave together their passionate, yet
restrained cry for mercy. The human passion of the
<i>Kyrie eleison</i> has its counterpart in the tender, almost
personal feeling of the <i>Christe eleison</i>, which is set as
a duet to an exquisitely melodious accompaniment of
the violin, and in the closing <i>Kyrie</i> chorus, which, instead
of being conceived in the usual way as a petition to
the Holy Spirit, resumes the tone of the first and sums
up the total supplication in a spirit now suggestive of
the broad treatment of the Catholic writers but soon
betraying the hand of Bach in its conciseness, its more
nervous motion and acuter harmonies. The same
abandoning of traditional currents in order that he
might go back straight to the springs lying deep in
the nature and experience of the world, to which the
office of the holy communion owes its life, is equally
manifest throughout the Mass. The <i>Gloria</i> becomes
again the angel-song of the nativity. Bach throws
himself at once into the spirit in which he wrote the
<i>Christmas Oratorio</i>; and of this great work the later
chorus is a sort of summary, to be used again for
performance at Christmas. But if his profound grasp
of the reality of that which he expressed is the
supreme excellence of Bach’s <i>High Mass</i>, no less
striking in its way is the discrimination with which
he treats the different elements of the Creed. Intellectual
dogmas find an intellectual rendering, as in the
curious places in which the union of the divine nature
in Christ is reflected by a canon, first in the unison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">Pg 101</a></span>
then in the fourth below. But doctrines which are
more directly bound up with the soul of Christianity
are recited with a fulness of living sympathy, which
feels the pathos of the human life of Christ, pulses
with unspeakable awe and an intensity almost terrific
at the rehearsal of his death, then springs up in most
glorious rejoicing at the resurrection. The declaration
of his personal faith did not obscure in Bach’s mind
the fact that he was writing a work which should hold
true for <i>the one catholic, apostolic church</i> of which
existing churches were all alike members. He
returns to this thought openly in the article of
baptism, where the Gregorian intonation, <i>Confiteor
unum baptisma</i>, is pronounced, as a second subject, by
the basses and wrought with superb art into the
texture of the fugue.</p>

<p>Words, however, can give but a very faint impression
of this masterpiece of universal Christendom; and
daring with forced fingers rude to touch its perfect
outline, I leave inviolate the lyrical tenderness of the
<i>Agnus Dei</i> and the yearning desire<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> of the <i>Dona nobis
pacem</i>, the restful consummation of the whole. Nor
can I describe the infinite fertility of the design, the
happy frequency with which in the <i>arie</i> a single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">Pg 102</a></span>instrument, violin, flute, hautboy, or horn, is made to
enhance the delicacy of the human voice, or the splendour
of the grouping of the orchestra, equally noble
in sonorous magnificence and in chastened softness.
Whether in its art or in its religion the High Mass
stands among the creations of Bach’s master-spirit,
first and alone, but for its sole equal, the <i>Passion
according to Saint Matthew</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>We quitted the direct narrative of Bach’s life at the
point when the arrival of the new rector of the
Thomasschule gave it an interval of peace and quietness,
an interval of which we took advantage to
review the great ranges of church-music which fell as
an official task to the cantor. The four years of
Gesner’s rule are the ripest and busiest in Bach’s life;
not that they include his greatest individual works,
with the notable exception of the <i>High Mass</i>, but that
they are the most productive, and of works attaining a
more uniform level of first-rate excellence than any
others. After 1735 Bach was content to relax somewhat,
and he employed his time, less in composing
new cantatas or the like, than in revising, solidifying,
and balancing his earlier works. He must also have
retired more into the quiet of his family life, and
devoted himself to his private pupils, after the blow
struck at his influence in the school by Gesner’s successor,
Ernesti.</p>

<p>Ernesti, a young man of great learning and a good
teacher, was as incapable as his father, the old rector
under whom Bach first taught, of grasping the primary
conditions of the school, namely, its combination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">Pg 104</a></span>
musical with general education. He was jealous of
the predominance of the former, and therefore started
with a bias against Bach. He succeeded in winning a
victory for his own schemes, but at the expense of the
ruin of the music. Bach was not the only sufferer;
the same dispute was going on elsewhere in Germany
at the time, and was in fact one of the incidents of a
transitional period in the history of education. The
Thomasschule from its double government, the cantor
having an equal supremacy in musical matters with
the rector’s in secular, was peculiarly liable to such a
conflict. Unless the two heads were joined by a strong
bond of sympathy, as happened with Bach and Gesner,
rivalry was, perhaps, inevitable. When Ernesti succeeded
to the place, we have not long to wait before
the unpleasant spectacle presents itself.</p>

<p>It is needless to follow the details of the quarrel
which kept Bach in a nervous state of exasperation for
nearly two years, and left him in official discomfort for
the rest of his life. Suffice it to say, that in 1736
Ernesti quite unwarrantably usurped the cantor’s right
of nominating the musical prefects. Bach’s contention
was throughout the just one, only he made the mistake
of losing his temper about it. However, it is to be
observed that his language, if occasionally violent, is
consistently to the point, and the musician shews
better breeding than the scholar, who is not ashamed
of vulgar abuse, charges of lying, and like scurrilities.
The whole thing, indeed, began by a scene that tells
strongly for Bach’s sense of justice. A prefect had
been, as he believed, wrongly condemned to a public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">Pg 105</a></span>
flogging before the school. Bach, who had had nothing
to do with his subordinate’s crime, interposed by
taking the whole blame upon his shoulders. The
rector was in a rage, and refused to remit the punishment:
so the prefect had to leave, and the rector
filled up the vacancy. Hence the quarrel. To Bach it
must have been irritating beyond bearing to have a
man, little more than half his age, intruding upon his
incontestable rights, still more to find the Town
Council and consistory unscrupulous in supporting the
claim of the stronger, by declining to disturb a right
which had no precedent. It was not until he had
appealed to the King, and delighted him by some
evening-music, produced when he was next at Leipzig,
that the matter came for a fair hearing. As often
happens, when we have elaborate documents of the
progress of a case, the conclusion has disappeared, but
it is presumed that the royal judgment was broader
than the indecent partiality of the Leipzig officials, and
that the grievance was redressed. But the harm had
gone too far to be undone, and while Bach and Ernesti
lived there was no more unity in the school. How
deeply Bach resented the injury is seen from the eager
interest he took in a quarrel that turned on the same
principles as his own, the very year before his death.
He not only had a <i>critique</i> of the offending school-*master
written and printed for him but actually
changed the phrasing of a secular cantata, <i>The Contest
of Ph&oelig;us and Pan</i>, when it was next performed, so as
to convey a covert sneer at him and Ernesti jointly.</p>

<p>One more assault came to disturb Bach’s tranquillity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">Pg 106</a></span>
a short time after the controversy with Ernesti had
come to an end. This was an insolent article by
Scheibe, a musician not without a superficial cleverness,
whom Bach had rejected as unqualified for a
certain organistship. It appeared anonymously in
Scheibe’s own review, the <i>Critische Musicus</i>, in 1737;
nor was Bach’s name given, though the reference was
too clear to escape notice. Bach is said to have
resented the attack, which was a mere flippant pasquinade
upon his music, bitterly; and he was almost
induced to enter into literary warfare in defence.
Happily we are spared the sight of a master in one art
essaying to use weapons with which he is sure to show
to disadvantage; and it was Bach’s friend, Magister
Birnbaum, who took up his cause for him.</p>

<p>Bach had certainly warm admirers and true friends
in Leipzig. His old pupils remained faithful to him,
and one, Altnikol, married his second daughter. Their
number continually increased with the master’s fame,
and among them are reckoned three at least of his
kinsmen and not a few musicians of high repute in the
younger generation, such as J. L. Krebs (afterwards
court organist at Altenburg), J. F. Agricola (capell-*meister
at Berlin), J. F. Doles (cantor of the Thomasschule),
G. A. Homilius (cantor of the Kreuzschule
at Dresden), and J. P. Kirnberger (a noted contra-*puntist,
and court musician at Berlin), not to mention
the most eminent of all, Bach’s two eldest sons. Another,
J. T. Goldberg, was the clavichord-player for whom
Bach made his <i>Thirty Variations</i>. He was attached to
the suite of the Baron von Kayserling, an invalid who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">Pg 107</a></span>
suffered greatly from sleeplessness. The Baron would
often have Goldberg pass the night in a room adjoining
his, that he might play to him when he could not rest.
Once he said to Bach that he should like to have some
music “of a soothing and rather cheerful character,
that he might be a little amused by them in his sleepless
nights.”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> To this request Bach replied by his
variations which combine a monotony of ground-work
with an endless variety of treatment, including canons
in all intervals, and winding up with a quodlibet of
delightful freshness.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> Kayserling was more than
amused by the present. He was never tired of hearing
the pieces, and “for a long time afterwards, when the
sleepless nights came, he used to say, <i>Dear Goldberg,
do play me one of my variations</i>:”&mdash;they were always
<i>his</i> variations. He thanked Bach for them with a gold
cup filled with a hundred louis-d’or (or about 75<i>l.</i>
sterling).</p>

<p>But while students thronged to Bach as a master;
and while he was often assailed by smatterers who only
wanted to be known as his pupils&mdash;and were disappointed&mdash;his
later years were years of declining
influence in Leipzig, precisely in proportion to his
increasing celebrity outside. Like Milton his fame
grew when public recognition failed. He became
merely one of the sights of the place. No musician
who passed through or near Leipzig was satisfied
without an interview. But when any real occasion
came, when his help and judgment would have been of
use, he was not called. I do not refer to the Society
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">Pg 108</a></span>of Musical Sciences, to which Bach was only admitted
years after it was established at Leipzig, and only as
an ordinary member with a canon sent in as testimonial.
Probably its scientific discussions on the theory of
music were little to Bach’s taste: perhaps he declined
to join at first; though to a man of smaller generosity
it would have been a blow to see Handel chosen as an
honorary member. The occasion on which even
courtesy should have decided a resort to Bach’s
advice and co-operation was the establishment in 1743
of the Grosse Concert, the parent of the famous concerts
of the Gewandhaus. It was arranged by an
association of rich burghers; and its tendencies were
from the outset in a distinctly modern direction.
Rossini&mdash;of all people&mdash;notes Dr. Spitta, supplanted
Beethoven among contemporaries; and the great
Leipzig master became a stranger in his own town.
But the fact that Bach had nothing to do with the
beginning of the decisive musical movement<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> of the
town does a great deal to fix his position in one’s
mind. Equally significant is the circumstance that
some time, perhaps some years, after 1736 he resigned
the leadership of the Musical Society over which he
had presided since 1729. If he was not to be first, he
preferred to retreat into privacy. This privacy must
have become closer when his three eldest sons left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">Pg 109</a></span>him to follow a musical calling elsewhere, Friedemann
at Dresden and then at Halle, Emanuel at Berlin, and
Bernhard at Muehlhausen. One daughter of his first
marriage was all that remained to him. Of the thirteen
children of his second marriage, seven died in early
childhood and one was an idiot. Friedrich and Johann
Christian were the only sons of musical promise; the
former became capellmeister to the Count of Schaumburg
at Bueckeburg, the latter made the name of
Bach famous in London drawing-rooms, but only
through his own thin productions. Born in 1735, he
was the darling of his father’s old age, and was the only
son who remained with his three sisters in the home
when Bach died.</p>

<p>With Friedemann and Emanuel their father always
kept near relations, as far as the difficulty of travelling
allowed. It was through the latter that Bach came to
make his famous visit to the court of Frederick the
Great. The king had often expressed a desire to see
him and Emanuel had informed his father of it. But
Bach was usually now too busy to undertake so long a
journey. At last, in 1747, he decided to go, and,
characteristically enough, fetched Friedemann from
Halle on the way to accompany him. I give the
account of the interview at Potsdam in the words of
Forkel, who had it from Friedemann himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At this time the king had every evening a private
concert, in which he himself generally performed some
concertos on the flute. One evening, just as he was
getting his flute ready, and his musicians were assembled,
an officer brought him the list of the strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">Pg 110</a></span>
who had arrived. With his flute in his hand he ran
over the list, but immediately turned to the assembled
musicians, and said, with a kind of agitation, <i>Gentlemen,
old Bach is come</i>. The flute was now laid aside,
and old Bach, who had alighted at his son’s lodgings,
was immediately summoned to the Palace.... At
that time it was the fashion to make rather prolix compliments.
The first appearance of J. S. Bach before so
great a King, who did not even give him time to
change his travelling-dress for a black chanter’s gown,
must necessarily be attended with many apologies. I
will not here dwell on these apologies, but merely
observe, that in William Friedemann’s mouth they
made a formal dialogue between the King and the
Apologist.</p>

<p>"But what is more important than this is, that the
King gave up his concert for this evening, and invited
Bach, then already called the Old Bach, to try his
fortepianos, made by Silbermann, which stood in
various rooms of the palace," and numbered fifteen.
"The musicians went with him from room to room,
and Bach was invited everywhere to try and to play
unpremeditated compositions." The king gave him a
subject to develop in fugue, and Bach concluded by
adding one that occurred to himself, which he extemporized
in six voices. It was the greatest display of
Bach’s life, and certainly an exhibition that has never
been equalled on its own lines. A permanent record
of the visit lies in the <i>Musikalische Opfer</i>, wherein
Bach treated the theme which the king had proposed
to him with an exuberance of learning and variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">Pg 111</a></span>
beyond the possibilities of <i>ex tempore</i> composition.
It comprises fugues in three and six parts, eight
canons, and a sonata for three instruments, ending in
a perpetual canon.</p>

<p>The <i>Musical Offering</i> has always been an object of
admiration for the ingenuity of its workmanship. But its
object was mainly the display of contrapuntal learning.
It was a <i>parergon</i> to which Bach delighted himself by
applying every resource of musical science; and therefore
stands on a different footing to the three great
collections of fugues which Bach composed, the last of
which was his employment almost to the time of his
death. The <i>Art of Fugue</i> stands nearest to the <i>Musical
Offering</i>, since it too consists of fugues and canons, all
upon a single subject. It differs from that work inasmuch
as here he wrote not to display his own skill, but
to illustrate the final possibilities of contrapuntal art.
But equally it appeals to a very limited class of musicians;
to us in the present moment it is chiefly
interesting as shewing that, if Bach’s productive
energy ceased comparatively early, his power only
became the more massive when he chose to use it.
Far otherwise is it with the two sets of preludes and
fugues through all the major and minor keys, called
the <i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i>.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> These no musician or
pianist can ignore with impunity; Schumann himself,
whose style of playing and composing lies at the anti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">Pg 112</a></span>podes
of Bach’s, commends them to “young musicians”
as their “daily bread.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>The Forty-Eight Preludes and Fugues were begun
partly with an educational purpose. Bach wished to
prove the capacity of the clavichord, now that he had
enlarged its sphere by an improved method of tuning,
and to impress this variety upon his pupils. The first
half, to which alone the title <i>Das Wohltemperirte Clavier</i>
properly belongs, was completed in 1722, just before
the author left Coethen; the second was finally arranged
some time before 1746, perhaps before 1740.
The labour and the years Bach took to mature these
great works seem to indicate that he regarded them
as representative works. Not a bar but was subjected
to the most thoughtful remodelling.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> The first part in
particular needed many a trial before it could find the
master’s approval, and thrice did he transcribe the whole
with his own hand. Every idea that was out of place,
every line that led nowhere, was ruthlessly pruned away.
When the root of the piece was reached, perhaps
the motive of the original would germinate afresh,
and the whole would assume a quite new and statelier
form. The two parts are in some measure distinguished
by the greater development of some of the
preludes in the second, which are now and then
sonatas on a small scale, and by the technical incompleteness
of some fugues in the first. But, though
the latter part is perhaps the richer and more full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">Pg 113</a></span>fancy, there is a symmetry about the whole series
which makes inconceivable that Bach should have not
intended the two parts to be combined. Indeed we
are told that Bach liked to have the whole played
through at a sitting. The work as it stands bears no
trace, except in its various readings, of the multiple
processes through which it has passed to gain each
time in purity and simplicity and freedom.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>For it must at the outset be explained that the
Forty-Eight were never intended as model fugues.
Learning was to Bach a means to an end. Except for
amusement, as in the <i>Musikalische Opfer</i>, he never
let it shew itself. To produce living work it
needed the touch of his imagination and the guidance
of his clear artist’s instinct. In fact, nothing is
freer than his management of the several voices
of a fugue. “He considered his parts,” it has
been finely said, “as persons, who conversed together,
like a select company. If there were three,
each could sometimes be silent, and listen to the
others, till it again had something to the purpose to
say. But, if in the midst of the most interesting part
of the discourse, some uncalled and importunate note
suddenly stepped in, and attempted to say a word, or
even a syllable only, Bach looked on this as a great
irregularity, and made his pupils comprehend that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">Pg 114</a></span>was not to be allowed." But “no part, not even a
middle part, was allowed to break off, before it had
entirely said what it had to say.... This high degree
of exactness in the management of every single
part is precisely what makes Bach’s harmony a manifold
melody.”</p>

<p>What Forkel here says of Bach’s part-writing in
general is true in an even fuller sense of the fugues.
I quote him because he was not only one of the most
learned contrapuntists of his day, but also a man who
discerned clearly the limits of counterpoint and the
difference between musical learning and musical art.
His description of the fugues is concise and plain, and
so much to the point that it deserves quotation here:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A highly characteristic theme, an uninterrupted
principal melody, wholly derived from it, and equally
characteristic from the beginning to the end; not
mere accompaniment in the other parts, but in each of
them an independent melody, according with the
others, also from the beginning to the end; freedom,
lightness, and fluency, in the progress of the whole,
inexhaustible variety of modulation combined with
perfect purity; the exclusion of every arbitrary note,
not necessarily belonging to the whole; unity and
diversity in the style, rhythmus, and measure; and
lastly, a life diffused through the whole, so that it
sometimes appears to the performer or hearer, as if
every single note were animated; these are the properties
of Bach’s fugue.... All Bach’s fugues ...
are endowed with equally great excellencies, but each
in a different manner. Each has its own precisely
defined character; and dependent upon that, its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">Pg 115</a></span>
turns in melody and harmony. When we know
and can perform one, we really know only one, and
can perform but one; whereas we know and can
play whole folios full of fugues by other composers of
Bach’s time, as soon as we have comprehended, and rendered
familiar to our hand, the turns of a single one."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>There is no work that realizes better the conception
of a perfect fugue than that in C sharp minor in the
first part of the <i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i>. That it is in
five voices and contains three subjects, are facts that
would by themselves place it among the most vertebrate
of the collection. But least of all does the
grandeur of the fugue rest upon its complexity. It
is the character-drawing of the several voices, and the
nobility of them, that make their discourse sublime&mdash;three
voices entirely contrasted and entirely blended&mdash;each
time with a new and surprising effect, now of
pomp, now of tenderest pathos&mdash;one a slow organ-voice,
the next delicate and flowing, and the third
vehement, striking hammer-blows. The second and
then the last gradually die away; the solemnity of the
original theme communicates itself again to the whole
web of thought, and the end is plaintive and restful.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>A story is told which displays in a characteristic
way Bach’s instinctive knowledge of the nature of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">Pg 116</a></span>fugue. When he happened to be in a strange church
where a fugue was announced, and one of his two
eldest sons stood near him, “he always, as soon as he
had heard the introduction to the theme, said before-*hand
what the composer ought to introduce, and
what possibly might be introduced. If the composer
had performed his work well, what he said happened:
then he rejoiced, and jogged his son, to make him observe
it.” Otherwise, it is added, his modesty made
him the most lenient of critics.</p>

<p>The <i>Art of Fugue</i> has already been mentioned as the
last and most massive of Bach’s works. It must have
been begun in 1749, and so careful was the author of
what he wished to be considered as his masterpiece&mdash;in
the strict sense&mdash;that he had it engraved under his
own eyes.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> He did not live to see it published<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>; the
carelessness or ignorance of those into whose hands
it came allowed it to appear with several extraneous
insertions, and its intended regular structure
of fifteen fugues and four canons upon a single
theme in D minor remained long obscured. Not
content with this gigantic fugue&mdash;for it is one fugue
through all its fifteen sections&mdash;Bach resolved to
penetrate still further into the labyrinth of har<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">Pg 117</a></span>monic
combinations, and to write, so it is said, a
fugue in four parts with four subjects, all of them to
be reversed in each of the parts. He had not, however,
gone much beyond the introduction of the third
subject, which contained in the German notation the
letters of his own name, when his excessive application
was terminated by a painful disorder in the eyes.
He had always been near-sighted, and now his vision
almost failed. He consulted an English oculist of
repute, who was then in Leipzig; but after two operations
he became totally blind, and the medical treatment
he underwent broke his hitherto hale constitution.
For half a year he declined, until he found his rest on
the evening of Tuesday, the 28th of July, 1750. Ten
days before his death his eyesight for a short space
suddenly returned to him. It was a few days after
that strange illumination that he called Altnikol, his
son-in-law, to him, and bade him write at his dictation
the chorale <i>When we are in the depths of need</i>. But
death had become a new presence to him. Often had
he lingered upon the idea in chorale and cantata; but
now he felt himself to have passed beyond the gulf.
He bade Altnikol set other words at the head of the
music. The words were these: <i>Herewith I come before
thy throne</i>.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">Pg 118</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>The fact of Bach’s death was registered by the Town
Council in the following terms: <i>The Cantor at the
Thomasschule, or rather the Capelldirector, Bach, is
dead</i>. They proceeded to resolve that <i>the school needed
a Cantor, and not a Capellmeister, although he must
understand music too</i>. Such was the public recognition
of Leipzig’s greatest man. His widow was suffered
to live on in need, and to die a pauper ten years
after her husband. The youngest daughter was at
last relieved by a public subscription, in which
Beethoven was proud to join; but not by the town.
The last infamy of Leipzig was achieved when
S. John’s churchyard, in which Bach had been laid
to rest, was rooted up and made into a road. His
bones were scattered, no man knew or cared where.</p>

<p>The boys of the Thomasschule, of course, followed
their cantor’s funeral, and one of his colleagues published
a short memorial upon his friend. But Bach
was very soon forgotten in his own school. His works
were doubtless performed, more or less frequently;
but cantatas and motets were required for the church
service, and it was easier to fall back upon the stores
of music he had left, than to buy or transcribe new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">Pg 119</a></span>
pieces. How little the treasure was valued we may
learn from the circumstance that in 1803 over a
hundred church compositions existed there in autograph,
while seven years later there remained but three
in score and forty-four in parts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the name, only the name, of Bach continued
powerful in Leipzig. When the Gewandhaus
was opened, in 1781, it was painted in great letters upon
a screen behind the orchestra; but nothing of his was
performed there until the concerts had existed for
more than half a century. It was his feeblest son,
Johann Christian, whose compositions were admired.
The visit of Mozart, in 1789, of which I have before
spoken, did something to revive the interest in Bach’s
music; but the process was a slow one. His works
became known among an increasing number of scattered
admirers; then they came to be partially published;
but it was not until 1842 that he had a
monument on the Promenade, behind the windows of
his old house, not until 1850 that a worthier monument
was begun in the establishment of the Bach Society,
whose collection of the master’s works has hardly an
equal in critical accuracy or magnificence of form.
The erection of the first was due to the efforts
of Mendelssohn; the second, in great measure, to
Schumann.</p>

<p>From these two monuments we turn again to their
original. Of Bach’s figure we know nothing but the
head and the square shoulders. His countenance was
one of singular dignity and refinement. The thick
eyebrows that stood out beneath his great forehead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">Pg 120</a></span>
knotted above his long firm nose, seemed to denote a
force, if not a severity, of character; but the impression
was softened by the sweet, sensitive lines of his
mouth. Both traits are true of the man. He had a
strong self-dependence, which was reflected in his
sense of duty, the consistency, the uprightness of his
life, but which was liable to exaggeration in self-will,
even obstinacy. Partly this was owing to his irritable
temperament, the other side of his nature, born of an
acute sensibility, which might reveal itself either so or
more often in the tender charities of his family life.
These double tendencies, the fine and the strong, had
their ground in his active and contemplative religious
faith; they find their testimony in his music. Only
here we see a third factor, not so manifest in his own
life, in the boundless flexibility of mind to which it
points. If, however, one is asked the dominant
characteristics of it, there is but one reply,&mdash;manliness
and melody, the one never too vigorous to overpower
the melody, the other restrained by it from
any approach to effeminacy.</p>

<p>It is these qualities that adjudge Bach the same
place among musicians as Milton holds among our
own poets; and the thought has a touching suggestion
in the lack of recognition of his later years, and in his
blindness. But the likeness goes deeper into their
work. Each is in his craft the most learned of artists;
each is ruled by an absorbing religious sense. They
are equals in chastened grace, in balance and ear;
and equally wanting in two special gifts, humour and
dramatic power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">Pg 121</a></span></p>

<p>This is not the place to pursue the parallel more
closely; but the statement of it may help us to realise
how little popularity can be taken as an index of
artistic worth, it may also serve as a warning to those
who insist on comparing Bach with other masters.
He can as little be compared with Beethoven, for instance,
as Milton with Shakespeare. That he should
have been constantly brought into comparison with
Handel was, perhaps, inevitable; but to see the
unfairness to both, it is only necessary to observe
that neither produced his best work in the same fields
as the other. Bach wrote nothing more than distantly
akin to the Oratorio; Handel attempted nothing great
in Masses or in Passion Music. Wherever they do
enter into comparison, only ignorance can excuse the
claim of superiority often made for Handel. So it is
remarkable when they are set side by side as organists.
With his prodigious brilliancy Handel was untrue to
the nature of the organ; he made it a concert-instrument.
Bach, on the other hand, developed its powers
to the utmost extent possible while preserving its
church character. Accordingly, it is not strange that
no single work for organ <i>solo</i> by Handel is known to
exist, while among contemporaries Bach was hardly
known except as an organ-master, and his works have
remained to organists the most precious of possessions.
Mattheson, no unqualified judge, courteously decided
that in this sphere their names must stand in alphabetical
order.</p>

<p>To complete the picture of Bach as a performer, we
must add to his command of the organ and clavichord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">Pg 122</a></span>
the skill he acquired as a violinist. In both his
appointments at Weimar this was his instrument, and
to have written and played the sonatas for violin solo,
he must almost have attained perfection in its technicalities.
But his favourite stringed instrument in later
years was the viola, because it placed him, “as it were,
in the middle of the harmony, whence he could best
hear and enjoy it, on both sides;”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> and, when he was
in the vein, he would extemporize an additional part
to a trio or whatever was being played. In the same
way he would at sight combine scores on the clavichord
with astonishing fluency. That he could readily expand
a figured bass is only to say that he was proficient
in the ordinary training of an accompanist; but
there are some details noticed by Forkel in this
connexion, which bear in an interesting manner upon
a vexed question of the present day, namely, the
lawfulness of writing “additional accompaniments”
to his vocal works, and must not be passed over.</p>

<p>Bach was able, we are told, “if a single bass part,
often ill-figured, was laid before him, immediately to
play from it a trio, or a quartet; nay, he even went so
far ... as to perform extempore, to three single parts,
a fourth part, and thus to make a quartetto of the
whole.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> The plain meaning of this is that, when he
pleased, he did not play simple chords to the given
bass, but extracted from them two or three strains of
independent melody. The principle has been applied
to many of Bach’s compositions, especially by Robert
Franz, whom a close study of the master led to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">Pg 123</a></span>opinion that, when Bach had left a vocal piece accompanied
only by a single bass, the natural way of
making the accompaniment satisfactory was to treat it
polyphonically, in the same style as Bach is recorded
to have done sometimes himself; in other words, to
write new parts over it in counterpoint and imitation.
The necessity for some such treatment is argued from
the decay, in modern times, of the art of expanding
even the common harmonies of a figured bass. The
real reason against it is that we may be thus obscuring
the relief of light and shade which Bach designed to
produce by leaving some pieces barely accompanied,
as in contrast to the elaborate orchestration of others.
This is more weighty than the argument drawn from
the absence of any authoritative example of it; as for
instance, that it is not to be found in some exercises
in figured bass by a pupil which Bach corrected. It
is obvious to answer that a master would probably be
content with accuracy in his scholar’s work, and would
not apply to it the same standard of elaboration, or
allow the same freedom of treatment, as he would
desire in his own. No doubt Bach employed, probably
he preferred for teaching purposes, a simple accompaniment
of three or four-part harmonies. But side
by side with this must be placed the testimony of a
pupil, that <i>he had never heard anything more excellent
than the singing of the voices among each other</i>, when
Bach accompanied: <i>the accompaniment was in itself so
beautiful that even the principal voice could not withdraw
from the pleasure he received from the accessory</i>. Failing
this faculty now-a-days, it is probably wisest to adopt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">Pg 124</a></span>
the judgment of Mendelssohn and limit the additional
accompaniment to the writing out of the implied organ
part.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>Two other facts demand notice in reference to the production
of Bach’s music in modern times. One is the
non-existence of distinctive <i>solo</i> singers. When an <i>aria</i>
was to be sung, a single member stood up out of the
body of the choir. This will explain the almost equal
difficulty of each. The other fact relates to the
proportion of the choir to the orchestra. In the last
century the latter regularly outnumbered the former;
and Bach’s own scheme for the organisation of the
music at S. Thomas’s desiderated only twelve singers
to a band of eighteen, exclusive of the organ&mdash;the
organ, be it remembered, being entrusted by Bach
with a very important part. Such a distribution must
have given the performances which he conducted a
different colour from that which they present now.
He did not separate the voices and the instruments so
broadly as we are accustomed to do. The voice was
to him hardly more than any other instrument; and if
we are to judge his music fairly, we must consider the
two elements of his band, not as choir and accompaniment,
but as one mass of sound, composed of two
balanced and co-ordinate parts.</p>

<p>It remains to give a brief sketch of the reception
which Bach has had in England. Probably Dr.
Burney, the learned historian of music, was the first to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">Pg 125</a></span>introduce him here; but he afterwards confessed that
his partial verdict was based solely upon a copy of the
first half of the Forty-Eight Preludes and Fugues&mdash;"a
vile and most diabolical copy," as it turned out,
fall of mistakes&mdash;and had never heard one played.
The first serious steps to promote the knowledge of
Bach in England were taken by a company of three
enthusiastic worshippers at his shrine; to one of whom
is due the honour of the first publication anywhere of the
<i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i>. It was brought out in London
by A. F. K. Kollman in 1799. The impulse thus given
was carried on by two leading musicians, Horn and
Wesley, who planned a complete edition of Bach’s
works. The series was begun in 1809, but, although
well received, did not proceed very far. Eleven years
later appeared a translation of Forkel’s <i>Life of Bach</i>.
The most interesting record, however, of this movement,
lies in a recently published collection of letters
by Samuel Wesley,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> the greatest organist of his time.</p>

<p>The little band of enthusiasts set out as the apostles
of a new religion. Wesley proclaimed his championship
of <i>Saint Sebastian</i>, as a sacred mission, in the
defence of truth and justice, against the idolaters of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">Pg 126</a></span>Handel&mdash;quite unconscious how necessarily such a
combat must resolve itself into mere partisanship, and
the very bigotry which he opposed. He has, however,
the credit of having convinced the redoubtable Burney
of the injustice of his published opinion of Bach, and
also of being the first in England to observe, what
Forkel had seized upon independently abroad, that of
his “characteristic beauties” “air” was “one of the
chief and most striking.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> No doubt his wonderful
playing of the organ did something to make Bach
known in England; but it was long before he was
really accepted. The movement, in fact, for a time
subsided; it was roused again into life by the energetic
work of Mendelssohn, who declared it was high time
that the “immortal master, who is on no one point
inferior to any master, and in many points superior to
all, should no longer be forgotten.” He prepared the
road for the successful labours of Sterndale Bennett,
who, as the most prominent English musician, was able
to force Bach into notice in London. In 1849, a year
before the foundation of the German Bach-Gesellschaft,
he established the Bach Society, with the main object,
however, not of publishing, but of producing the works
of Bach. By this the <i>S. Matthew Passion</i> was performed
in 1854 and 1858, to be followed by part of
the <i>High Mass</i>, and lastly by the <i>Christmas Oratorio</i>.
Moreover, as musical professor at Cambridge, Sir</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">Pg 127</a></span></p>
<p>William extended the study of Bach in a wider circle;
and it was taken up by many provincial associations.
In the meanwhile Schumann’s widow was asserting, by
her wonderful playing, the rightful place of Bach’s
clavichord works among the treasures of the pianist.
At length in 1871, the <i>S. Matthew Passion</i> was produced
at Westminster Abbey, and since that time,
there, or in S. Paul’s Cathedral, the <i>Passion Music</i> and
the <i>Christmas Oratorio</i> have taken their constant
position as the special services of Holy Week and the
new year. Other churches in London, notably S.
Anne’s, Soho, have taken up the example, and the
formation of the Bach Choir has added a new zeal to
the cultivation of the master. If England was late in
acknowledging his greatness, nowhere now are his
works performed more regularly, and nowhere does he
stand in so wide and so assured a popularity.</p>

born a month earlier; and English notices, since the year in
this country began on the 25th of March, place his birthday in
1684. That this should create a misconception in the minds of
foreign writers was natural; but it is curious that they have
all failed to detect the source of the confusion, and unanimously
exposed an imaginary error.</p></div>

preludes and fugues in C and A minor (Peters, v. 3. 7, 9) and
a fantasia in G (v. 4. 11). Another fantasia and a fugue, both
in G and presumably of the same period, remain in MS., one in

in E flat (a MS. in Dr. Rust’s possession), and a fugue in E
minor seem to belong to the Arnstadt period, if indeed this
latter does not date as far back as Lueneburg. It appears at
No. 212, p. 12, of Peters’ cheap edition, to which, as the most
generally accessible, I always refer for the clavichord works.</p></div>

of three members of the consistory are absent; they
offer a pathetic excuse. Their houses had just been burnt to
the ground in a great fire that had laid waste much of the town,
and they were destitute even of the means of signing their
names, <i>hätten keine Feder oder Tinte, wären wegen des

gave to it, changing the soprano into a bass <i>solo</i>.
Possibly <i>Wer nur den lieben Gott lässt walten</i> (93) had a like
origin: see Spitta, ii. 274 f., 302 f., 269 ff. A secular cantata of
which the subject closely resembles that of the two first-named
works should seem to belong to the same category: it is printed

recall entirely the old English song, <i>Tobacco’s but an Indian

Wither’s delicious verses, with the refrain <i>Thus think and

<p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> Bach’s thankfulness has often this same emotional tenour.
In the Mass it is made conspicuous by the identity of the music
of the <i>Dona nobis</i> with that of the <i>Gratias agimus</i>. The subject
is an old church one. Bach had used it before in the great
chorus of his Rathswahl-Cantate of 1731, <i>Wir danken dir, Gott</i>
(No. 29), where the similar, but different and less elaborate
treatment of the same subject&mdash;the second subject also is all but
identical&mdash;offers an instructive study.</p></div>

The <i>Kunst der Fuge</i> is edited by Dr. Rust in the twenty-fifth

in Bach’s lifetime were the five parts of the <i>Clavier-Uebung</i>

<p><a name="Footnote_77_77" id="Footnote_77_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> The chorale was added in the first edition of the <i>Kunst der
Fuge</i>, and its place there, though musically irrelevant, is surely
justified by a fine sentiment. Forkel touchingly says, “The
expression of pious resignation, and devotion in it, have always
affected me whenever I have played it; so that I can hardly
say which I would rather miss&mdash;this chorale, or the end of the
last fugue,” p. 91. The rigour of criticism has of course relegated
the piece to the category of organ-works (vii. 58).</p></div>

few more amusing examples of ardent hero-worship than this
collection contains. Bach is first “our Demi-God,” “our grand
Hero,” “our Sacred Musician,” “our Apollo,” “this marvellous
Man.” At length Wesley’s rhetoric fails, and his idol becomes
“<span class="smcap">The Man</span> (which expression I prefer to any epithet of <i>great</i>,
or <i>wonderful</i>, &amp;c., which are not only common, but <i>weak</i>, as is
every other epithet applied to one whom none can sufficiently
